<td>Rameses III. Senator Aldrich came to tea and gave us some authentic information as to the cause of Mr. Morgan's erratic behavior. He says Mr. Morgan was far from well and was greatly disappointed in his new dahabya "Kargeh" because she was so slow, and that everything seemed to go wrong, and he got tired of the whole business and dashed back to Cairo. Wednesday, February 19. Today I had a distinct sensation. I went over this aﬁemoon to the Rameses III to call on Mrs. and Miss Byers, whom I found very pleasant - Miss Byers struck me as being a quite rare and lovely person - and while there I saw no less a person than Rudyard Kipling. It seemed so strange that that little (he's very short) commonplace looking man should be packed with such extraordinary genius. I went on from the Rameses to the Winter Palace to have tea with Mrs. Pier and Madam Legrain, and then home. And tonight Don's dined on the Rameses with the Byers and then drove with them to Kamak to see that wondrous place in the moonlight. She says it surpassed any moonlight vision she ever heard or dreamed of. Thursday: February 20. The memory of today will always be a mingled one of the Contessa and grateful warmth. The Contessa invited me to spend the day with her, so I went over about noon and we sat and baked in the sheltered sunlight in the Luxor Hotel garden. It must be 15 or 20 degrees warmer on that side of the river than with us, and I've been hankering for the heat of the sun to annihilate my aches. The Luxor Hotel itself is a gloomy place and I can't think why the Contessa chooses to stay there. The garden is the only tolerable part. We had coffee there after luncheon in the dismal dining room, and then we made a tour of the antiquity shops which I found vastly amusing. Everywhere it was woe at Mr. Morgan's departure without even a look at things that had been saved for him for weeks. It was at Hassan's at the end of our rounds, that I saw the only things I really wanted. It's surprising how ephemeral many of one's desires prove themselves if one refrains from plunging into buyingthe moment one gets to a strange place. Dozens of things I thought fascinating when I ﬁrst began to look about the shops, I now pass with averted gaze because they tire me so. But Hassan brought out ten little alabaster jars (tunbler shaped) with a cartouche sunk in the side of each and colored blue, and an alabaster cover to each the size and shape of a large cream peppermint, and I coveted them with my whole heart. But the price of even one of the darling things was too much for me.
