<td>thoroughly enjoy belonging to the conquering and superior races. I hate to have silent, poor, inoffensive people pushed off the public highway in order to give me three times more room than I need. Thursday. March 13. Nag Hamadi. It has been a perfectly hateful day - with the wind blowing everything and everybody off the face of the earth. We tied up here in the middle of the day because it was too dangerous to go through the drawbridge in such a gale. It is a cold and glittering night. The Mayflower, presumably with Mr. Weston on board, is lying on the other side of the river, waiting for the opening of the bridge in the morning.

The Nile near Giegole. This has been a great day - one of the best we've had in Egypt. We reached Beliana about eleven I think, and as soon as we could after that we started for Abydos - Doris and Haneen on donkeys, and Amelie and I in a brougham (of all things in the world to drive about Egypt in) with a coronet on the door! Also there was a very gorgeous native policeman on a proud Arabian barb prancing beside us. They say Beliana is a very bad town - and somehow it looked it. The eight mile drive to Abydos is through such beautiful country. As you leave the town there seem to be great estates on either side with fine palm groves. Then come vast fields of grain, green and golden, and reaped and stacked and many flocks and herds, and the abodes of the tribes tending them are out in the broad flat topped stacks of grain! And there was so much joyous young life bounding and cavorting about the fields and on the highway, baby donkeys, baby camels, baby calves and kids and lambs. The temple of Teli I at Abydos is so surrounded by hills of rubbish that it has the effect of being a sunken one, and the facade is so very ruinous that the splendors of the interior are all the more striking, - the most beautiful carving, it seemed to us, that we've seen in Egypt. We found a Cook's party of about twenty-five having luncheon in the temple, and being starving we promptly had ours, beginning with a libation to the gods as Haneen dropped the water bottle just as we entered. It was delightful wandering about the temple. So much of the roof is gone that much of the place basks in sunlight. We did not go to the other temple - that of Rameses II - because it is a very inferior one, and we didn't want to take too much time. As we were leaving, the onslaught of natives with things to sell and natives who only wanted to beg and everybody yelling at once, and their vanquishing by Amelie, reminded me of a verse in the Psalms "They came about me like flies - and were extinct even as fire among thorns". Again we had the delights of the drive, marred only by a tearing wind. Once our horse shied violently at a Beduin riding by on a camel in the deep ditch by the high road. Our driver explained that the horse disliked the Beduin headdress. As we neared our Beduin on the road by the river we had to make our way through trains of camels laden with bags of onions which were being unloaded from ghiassas (I don't know how to spell them, but they are the native boats with the Viking prows and enormous sails). We got back in ample time to pull up stakes and make some headway before nightfall. Saturday. March 15. Tied above Abutig. It's been another day spoiled by a tearing wind which destroys all the pleasure of being on deck. Early this morning before we were up we passed Cook's Steamer Amenartis on her way to Aswan, with Emily and Marian Whitney on board. I'm so sorry to have missed them at Luxor. We have passed Akhenim, a very large and flourishing native town, to which, according to tradition, a heathen princess once came riding to desecrate a temple, and the earth opened and swallowed her up. The most beautiful sight today was what looked like the preparing of a caravan to go somewhere into the interior - camels were being loaded with all kinds of strange things and the mingling of colors was quite ravishing. We are getting into the land of colored raiment again instead of the black and white of <span id="l4086.4086" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r4086.4086').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r4086.4086').style.background='greenyellow'" title="u"><font color="red">U</font></span>pper Egypt.
