It was very cold and the land looked very dreary and nowhere as beautiful as at Luxor.

We plunged almost instantly from that highly civilized hotel courtyard and gardens into an utterly desperate desert - a truly terrible place with none of the beauty of the desert at Luxor. The ruined little habitations, the ruined little cemeteries, the strange rocks with inscriptions scattered here and there, only added in my eyes to the general horror of the desolation. There were about three miles of that and then, again with complete abruptness, we found ourselves in a charming little oasis of a compound, with neat and pretty bungalows, lovely trees and gardens and verdant terraces - the little village where the government employees connected with the dam live. We walked across the barrage, a mile and a quarter, and the little talking we did was done in exclamations. On one side, within eight feet of the top of the barrage, lay the Nile in a placid lake. On the other, at least a hundred feet below, through a very few of the 180 sluices the water thundered and leapt and boiled almost like Niagara at the base of the falls, and then spread itself out in many streams that flowed among the numberless wild masses of strange rocks that make up the riverbed in that region.
