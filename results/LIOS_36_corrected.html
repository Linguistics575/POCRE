<td>Rameses III. Senator Aldrich came to tea and gave us some authentic information as to the cause of Mr. Morgan's erratic behavior. He says Mr. Morgan was far from well and was greatly disappointed in his new dahabya "Kargeh" because she was so slow, and that everything seemed to go wrong, and he got tired of the whole business and dashed back to Cairo.

The memory of today will always be a mingled one of the Contessa and grateful warmth. The Contessa invited me to spend the day with her, so I went over about noon and we sat and baked in the sheltered sunlight in the Luxor Hotel garden. It must be 15 or 20 degrees warmer on that side of the river than with us, and I've been hankering for the heat of the sun to annihilate my aches. The Luxor Hotel itself is a gloomy place and I can't think why the Contessa chooses to stay there. The garden is the only tolerable part. We had coffee there after luncheon in the dismal dining room, and then we made a tour of the antiquity shops which I found vastly amusing. Everywhere it was woe at Mr. Morgan's departure without even a look at things that had been saved for him for weeks.
