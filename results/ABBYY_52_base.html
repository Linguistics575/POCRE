<td>I think, in a way, that is the most amazing sight I've seen in Egypt. Those enormous subterranean passages, those incredible titanic sarcophagi of granite, the inconceivable labor and ingenuity of it all, in order that the sacred bulls should be fittingly buried! Certainly they were an extraordinary people, those ancients of Egypt. We finished our sightseeing with the tomb of Thir, where I got so tired that I began to think of the back of my camel as a haven of rest. Then we mounted, had our photographs taken, and turned our faces homeward. It took us just two hours to return and when we got to Mena House at six we drank quarts of tea. We asked the waiter when the next train would leave for Cairo and he replied "The next train has gone!" So we telephoned for a motor and got back just in time to dress for our eight o'clock dinner. The wonders of Sakkara are very great, but in my memory the chief glory of today will always be that enchanting ride over the desert under that vast, vast sky of triumphant blue with heaped up masses of snowy cloud, the sweet, wild wind in our faces and the effects of light and of drifting cloud - shadow things of indescribable beauty. Tuesday. April 1. Cousin Theodore had such a dreadful tooth this morning that I took him to the dentist's and had it out. He suffered so horribly a year ago because he didn't have a tooth out, that we didn't delay it on this occasion for fear he would change his mind. The news of Mr. J. P. Morgan's death came this morning. Cairo is bursting into bloom as befits the time of year. The flowering trees are something ecstatic. We have one in the gardens of this place that is a dream of beauty. I think it's a kind of magnolia - a very large tree with small blossoms. This afternoon Cousin Emma and I left cards on Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay, and on Mrs. Graham, an Englishwoman whose husband is one of the officials here, and then I came back to the hotel for the great pleasure of having Emily and Marian Whitney to tea. It was so nice to see them. We had tea in the great hall which was once the scene of an atrocious crime. This palace was the one Ismail built for the Empress Eugenie to occupy at the opening of the Suez Canal. After that he had it for one of his own royal abodes. He had a foster brother who was supposed to be his closest friend and his dearest one. He took him to drive one day and, on their return, as they entered the great hall, guards seized the foster brother and killed him there while that unspeakable beast, Ismail, strolled up the marble staircase as though nothing were happening. After tea, Mr. Hine, the manager, took us through the Casino. It is so unattractive on the outside that I had never taken the trouble to go in, little imagining the splendors of the interior. But it seems it was a part of the royal harem and many of the old furnishings are still there, and it is really regal. After we'd seen that I got a carriage and took the Whitneys to the Beduin as they never had seen the inside of a dahabya. They graciously said they found it even more interesting than a royal palace. They wanted me to go back with them to dine at their hotel, but I couldn't. Wednesday. April 2. The birds in the gardens about this place are legion. At night you can hear the mewing owls and a lovely call in a chord of two notes that I'm told is made by a charming little plover that flies in pairs after dark. Early in the morning all kinds of birds begin shouting madly, and when we are dressing sometimes a dashing black or gray crow sits on the railing of our balcony cawing forcibly at us and waiting for us to leave the room so that he may fly in and carry off things from the dressing table. And today when Doris and I passed through the salon of this suite, two sparrows were sitting facing each other in two gilt framed, yellow brocaded chairs. They fly in and out as they list. We all five of us motored about in a more or less aimless fashion this morning. And once the Khedive flashed by us like a flame in his car.
