From his mutilated utterances I gleaned that his name was Mourse, that his home was Cairo, and that I was a nice lady. There was no village in sight but a flock of brown sheep were feeding on the herbage upon the slope near the river, and were being minded by a group of women and some little children who said "How-do, how-do" as I passed by. Coming back the wind was against us and I reached the Beduin in a state of heat and fatigue, and with that sense of virtue that one has after having taken a walk one didn't want to take. The wind fell late in the afternoon and we went a few miles farther down before tying up for the night near Silaileh. Yesterday a sandbar and the bridge at Esneh furnished our chief excitements. The sandbar held us fast for an hour or more, and it was amusing to watch the various tactics employed to get us afloat. Once some of the crew took off their turbans, stripped to the waist, went into the river and set their splendid shoulders against the boat (the Beduin herself actually got stuck that time) and pushed.

Our hours here are numbered and I feel as though I couldn't let them go. For some reason it's nice to be departing - for we are really now turning our faces homeward and there are Italy and England to be taken in by the way, but there's so much here that I've not really seen - and the place itself is so hauntingly beautiful. I thank Heaven that mine eyes have seen it. Cousin Theodore and Doris went for one more ride this afternoon, but I had to do the society act for the family - going out to say good-bye to the teachers at the Mission School, and then to tea with the Contessa. That poor lady, instead of going to Cairo immediately after our departure for Aswan - as she intended - was ill in bed for a week and looks quite shocking. We had a charming time together and tea out in the garden. She says that Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, says that our finds this winter have been the only ones of any importance in this region. The men at the American House (i.e., the Metropolitan Museum diggers) have found nothing but trifles like beads, etc. Lord Carnarvon and his digger - the captious Mr. Howard Carter - have been working like mad for weeks without stopping at all for the weekly holiday, and with a force of 300, and have found nothing. "And Carnarvon bears it", says Mr. Tremaine, who has somehow been completely hypnotized by that degenerate peer, "as only Carnarvon could!" Having lofty souls ourselves we are sorry the others have been unsuccessful, but considering how Howard Carter sneered to us one day about Harry Burton's capacity as a digger, we are too enchanted that it was Harry who made the important finds, and Harry himself is so happy he looks like a different man. Tuesday. March 11. And our last day at Luxor - a perfectly beautiful one like so many, many that have preceded it. Harry came over from the valley quite early to spend the day and make his final report about the diggings which closed down yesterday. He stopped work ad Medinet Habu a week ago, and spent the final week clearing up things in Siphtah where he found alabaster fragments which, when pieced together, made 18 Ushabti! He presently crossed over to Luxor to pick up Cousin Emma and Doris who had gone there, and at luncheon time they had much tittle-tattle to communicate. They had encountered the youngest son of the German Emperor, and Doris was rejoicing that she was not a Royal Prince, if they looked like that - with positively no chin at all.</td><td>new set of rings every other week to wear upon his tattooed hands) dogging my steps.
