Wednesday. March 12. Dendereh. It's hard to say which was the more beautiful - the dawn I saw this morning at Luxor or the sunset from the top of the temple here. It was a hectic leaving. About eleven we got off, and for two hours before that the sands in our immediate vicinity were dotted with natives come to say good-bye in the hope of a final backshish. Mrs. Winlock and Dorothy Richardson rode over from the American House to bid us farewell. Mohammed Mohassib came in a steam launch and was both pathetic and impressive. He is a great personality. He is planning to take his grandson and go to Mecca later on - for when we and his other foreign friends are gone there will be "no nice people in Luxor, no nice people at all."

By the "Indian billow", yes - but never by the waters of the Nile. "I strew these opiate flowers On thy restless pillow; They were plucked in Orient bowers By the Indian billow. May thy sleep be calm and deep Like theirs who fell - not theirs who weep." White and pink and violet and red they stretched in vast fields and were a joy to look upon. We got here about five and Doris and I immediately started for the temple on foot. Jones said it was a "very short walk" and on this boat a very short walk means not more than ten minutes.
