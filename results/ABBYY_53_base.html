<td>and I motored out to Mena House for tea, and on the way we saw a quite horrid sight. The sidewalk in front of a handsome house was drenched with blood, and a dead buffalo was just being dragged away by the heels. Neither Cousin Theodore nor Harry knew what it meant, but I did, having just read about the custom in a book called "Veiled Women". It's one of their pleasing little marriage ceremonies when a bride enters her new home to cut the throat of a live buffalo in front of her at gateway or door. This must go in its unfinished condition. These are such crowded days, and such beautiful ones -the air goes to my head like wine. Much love to you all. My next will probably be posted at Naples. Your devoted Mary. April 11. S. S. Prince Heinrich The Mediterranean Dearest Adeline:- I'm not sure about the number of this letter but it's next to the one I stopped abruptly last week. Our winter in Egypt is a thing of the past, but with spring in Italy and England before us, and Home after that, we go on our way rejoicing in spite of certain regrets and the fact that camels have dropped out of our lives "it may be for years and it may be forever". Chief among my regrets are the following: I did not see Lord Kitchener I did not see a polo game I saw no dervishes. While we were at Luxor there was some sort of a function that brought the dervishes to Cairo, and they lay in the street while their sheik rode over them on horseback. We read about it in the papers. Certainly some of the spectacles in Egypt are lurid ones, and I thank Heaven I belong to the Anglo-Saxon race. Doris and Harry saw a sight the day we went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which haply escaped me as we flashed by in the motor car, and that was children prisoners in chains. I should think Lord Kitchener would "advise" the Khedive to discontinue that practice. However, I suppose it takes time for even a giant like Kitchener to correct all of the worst abuses in a land so packed with them. That expedition to the Tombs of the Caliphs I hug to my memory with special delight because we came near not seeing them and it would have been such a loss. They make, on the outskirts of Cairo and close to the edge of the desert, a little city of their own crowned with beautiful domes and exquisite minarets, and are so wrapped in sunshine and loveliness that there is no thought of gloom. That same day we went to see a mosque whose name no one could remember and the guide books were all packed. But it's the second largest one in the world and is a beauty, with its hundreds of columns built around a large and arid court in the center of which is a well and one tree. The two principal things that are pointed out to you are the granite column and a magic stone. The granite column came to the mosque all by itself from Mecca. And the stone is possessed of healing properties so that when the Faithful have aches in their tummies they go and lick the stone till their tongues bleed. They've licked a deep groove in the stone and the whole thing looks quite horrid.
