<td>During the last week in Cairo there was a little social flavoring mixed in with shopping, sightseeing and the daily round. I lunched one day with the Contessa and Mr. Trema<span id="l172.172" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r172.172').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r172.172').style.background='greenyellow'" title="y"><font color="red">i</font></span>ne at the Continental, and Mr. Trema<span id="l209.209" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r209.209').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r209.209').style.background='greenyellow'" title="y"><font color="red">i</font></span>ne, putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out a little wad of paper, said "Here, Mrs. Newberry, is an antique I've been carrying about for weeks meaning to give you" and there was a heavenly bit of the perfect Egyptian blue with the sacred eye or Ho<font style="background-color:aquamarine">u</font>rs on it - the very thing I had hunted for in vain in the shops at Luxor. I've had it set in a ring and it's fascinating. Various people came to call, among them Watson Pasha, a Personage indeed in Egypt, being the Khedive's one English aide. I was out the afternoon he came but I met him a day or two after at a tea at the Grahams and found him a most delightful person. Lean and tanned and simple and direct and amusing. So tanned that if it were not for the clear cut, clean English features he might easily have been taken for a native. The King of Siam did take him for one. He had been sent to meet that potentate and escort him through the Suez Canal. Major Watson was wearing the uniform of the Egyptian Army and as His Majesty of Siam shook hands with him<font style="background-color:aquamarine">)</font> he said "I hope it is perhaps that you speak a few words of English". As he told me this story he was taking his amber cigarette holder from a gold case. "That is the most sumptuous thing I ever saw" I said. "Wait!" said he and brought out a gold cigarette case and a gold matchbox. "Backshish" he explained. "They can't give me money so they give me these things and I'd so much rather have a check for a thousand pounds!" The Grahams' place is one of the sweetest I've ever seen, such lovely gardens, such beautiful trees, - a fresh proof of the truth of what I've always said that the English have a genius for taking England with them wherever they go. We had tea on the verandah, and black and grey crows were waiting close by, until we should turn our backs, to steal the cakes. Our last evening in Cairo was a dream of beauty with the slenderest thread of a new moon floating above a towering ara<font style="background-color:aquamarine">u</font>caria in the garden. The Ghezireh people must have been glad to have us go - they'd been keeping the hotel open just for us and closed it when we left.

Various people were at the station to see us off, including seven of the crew of the Beduin, all there were left in Cairo, the others having scattered. They all shook all our hands three separate times and my friend Moh<span id="l2663.2664" onmouseout="document.getElementById('r2663.2664').style.background='none'" onmouseover="document.getElementById('r2663.2664').style.background='greenyellow'" title="o"><font color="red">a</font></span>mmed, the second captain, looked perfectly superb. We left Cairo at 9:45 and for three hours and a quarter our train sped through lovely scenes. We sailed at two that afternoon and the infinite boredom of seafaring has soaked to the marrow of my bones. There are a lot of awfully good looking men on board and if I knew some of them it might relieve my ennui - but the voyage is too short for making acquaintances. There are three Les Altesses, one of whom has a face like a Japanese mask and blows his nose so deafeningly and oft that I'm in constant fear that Cousin Theodore will speak to him about it. But the Prince and Princess Radziwill (I can't spell it) look the part quite satisfyingly. It has been a polar sea today instead of a summer one. I do so hope we shall find a little warmth in Italy. We expect to arrive in Naples at noon tomorrow. Heaven bless you all, my dears. Devotedly, Mary P.S. Saturday A.M.
