<td>"died man" on the island. We had to row back as the two men managing the boat were afraid to sail her in a fierce and contrary wind, which incidentally fairly blew our luncheon out of our mouths. It was such heart-breaking work, the rowing, that I made the men land us on a sandy point some distance from our destination. And I would not have missed a close inspection of that sand for much. It was turquoise blue and golden yellow. I don't expect to be believed, and if Doris hadn't seen it too, I would have thought I had gone color mad. We came home in a boat rowed by savages, one of whom beat upon a drum made of a hide stretched over a broken water jar, and sang wild ditties of his tribe I should imagine. The tiller of the boat was managed by a black baby aged about five. Shortly after we started on our downward voyage there shot out from a cove three tiny boats made of tin, in each of which sat a coal black little boy, two of whom were naked and the third jauntily attired in a turban and very short waistcoat. They paddled their crafts with tin disks, one in each hand. They pursued us madly demanding backshish, which of course they got. It has been a marve<font style="background-color:aquamarine">l</font>lous expedition. Thursday. March 6. The wind apparently blows all the time at Aswan and dries one up so you have to use pounds of cold cream. We shifted our position this morning, leaving the channel between Elephantine and the Cataract House, and moving over to the other side of Elephantine and tying up opposite the Grenfell tombs. The felucca took us over there after luncheon - Doris and me - and two of the sailors helped us to climb the rather terrific flight of steps to the tombs. The tombs are so simple and crude and archaic and different that we found them very interesting. But the glorious views we had afterwards interested me much more. We live so low down in our dahabya that I'm beginning to have a frantic craving for heights. So, the tombs duly visited, we went on with our climbing. Doris and her sailor climbed to the very top and saw "hundreds of miles" she said - off over the desert. My left leg still being somewhat stiff I stopped when part way up and sat on a ruined wall on a spur of the hill and gazed down upon river and town and desert, many sunburned naked native towns, one perfectly superb sycamore tree, a train of camels on a beach near the steamer landing, and a fleet of snowy sails racing down the Nile. We were sorry we didn't stay longer, for when back on the Beduin the wind made the deck untenable and drove us below. We are off early tomorrow morning without having set foot on Elephantine! I rejoice to think of the long river trip before we finally reach Cairo.

West Bank at Luxor again. Dearest Adeline:- Here we are once more, not exactly in the old spot, because we found that usurped by an English dahabya - so we had to tie up a couple of boat lengths above. We arrived about 10:30 this morning and it is all so beautiful. Doris and I love this part of the river much more than those wild a lonely stretches near Aswan, and nowhere since we left here, eight days ago, have we seen anything as superb as the Libyan Range. We left Aswan early Friday morning with optimistic expectations of a smooth and rapid trip, having the current with us to aid our good little tug. But it was a case of sitting on sandbars every little while, with a head wind that was a gale and so heavy a "sea" on that it actually got too exciting, and so we sought as sheltered a spot as we could find and tied up about luncheon time in wait till the wind should fall. I took a walk early in the afternoon but Doris declared such a proceeding much too energetic for her.
