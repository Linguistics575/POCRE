The 
boisterous 
Mor 
Whymper 
came 
to 
breakfast 
. 
I've 
decided 
all 
that 
\
excitable 
volubility 
in 
his 
company 
\b \cf3 [DELETED: !] \b0 \cf2
er 
because 
when 
he 
crosses 
over 
\
with 
Don's 
and 
me 
in 
the 
felucca 
on 
our 
way 
to 
church 
he 
is 
quite 
pleasantly 
\
quick 
and 
his 
face 
in 
repose 
is 
sad 
\b \cf3 [DELETED: )] \b0 \cf2
I 
went 
to 
church 
and 
adler 
he 
\
They 
grow 
more 
and 
more 
delightful 
. 
Two 
English 
ladies 
came 
to

I 
believe 
they 
he 
\
warmest 
day 
we've 
had 
I 
think 
, 
and 
today 
there 
has 
been 
a 
touch 
of 
\
Khamse 
the 
how 
thick 
Wind 
of 
Egypt 
. 
It 
made

The

Doris

I 
dashed 
across 
the 
river 
immediately 
after 
\
breakfast 
to 
buy 
Soudanese 
beads 
together 
, 
and 
then 
I 
dashed 
back 
again, 
\
leaving 
her 
to 
play 
with

Just

up

I 
was 
in

was 
very 
glad 
to

\
was 
freshly 
impressed 
with 
how 
awful 
it 
would 
be 
to 
go 
about 
in 
a 
Cook's 
party

Infinitely

\
wonder 
if 
it's 
often 
given 
to 
human 
eyes 
to 
see 
anything 
more 
beautiful 
than 
\
the 
Libyan 
\b \cf3 ange \b0 \cf2 
was 
to 
mine 
as 
I 
saw 
it 
from 
the 
front 
terrace 
of 
the 
Winter 
\
Palace 
today 
in 
all 
the 
splendor 
in 
he 
glamour 
of 
the 
late 
afternoon 
light 
\
It 
strikes 
me 
with 
fresh 
joy 
every 
time 
I 
look 
at 
it 
froze 
that 
particular 
\
place 
and 
at 
that 
hour 
. 
The 
Beguin 
has 
suck 
so 
with 
the 
falling 
river 
that 
\
from 
the 
salons 
we 
can 
no 
longer 
see 
even 
the 
tip 
top 
of 
the 
\b \cf3 ange \b0 \cf2 
and 
\
even 
from 
the 
upper 
deck 
we 
do 
not 
get 
it 
in 
its 
full 
majesty 
as 
they 
do 
from 
\
the 
Winter 
Palace 
. 
When 
we 
first 
tied 
up 
here 
we 
could 
see 
the 
\b \cf3 ange \b0 \cf2 
and 
all 
\
the 
intervening 
stretch 
of 
deser 
and 
green 
from 
the 
salon 
window 
which 
will 
\
give 
you 
some 
idea 
of 
how 
the 
river 
has 
dropped 
When 
I 
got 
back 
to 
the 
Bedun 
\
I 
found 
Mrs 
. 
Her 
and 
the 
Countess 
having 
toa 
. 
They 
had 
stopped 
on 
their 
\
way 
home 
from 
an 
all 
day 
expedition 
to 
the 
\b \cf3 valey \b0 \cf2 
of 
the 
Tombs 
of 
the 
Apes 
\
They 
had 
asked 
Don's 
and 
me 
to 
go 
, 
but 
vic 
declined 
because 
Cousin 
I 
was 
\
not 
feeling 
we 
\b \cf3 I \b0 \cf2 
. 
This 
morning 
Cousin 
Ermine 
and 
nor's 
\
went 
over 
Mohammed 
Mehassit 
and 
the 
Luxor 
temple 
etc 
. 
while 
\
Cousin 
Theodore 
and 
I 
settled 
ourselves 
with 
the 
dominoes 
on 
deck 
. 
In 
the 
\
middle 
of 
a 
the 
sound 
of 
many 
bicats 
eroge 
upon 
the 
air 
ranging 
from 
\
deep 
paternal 
ones 
to 
ling 
appealing 
baby 
bells 
and 
over 
the 
sands 
came 
block 
\
of 
dark 
brown 
shoop 
with 
four 
men 
and 
some 
children 
shepherding 
them. 
\
They 
came 
straight 
to 
the 
little 
cove 
just 
at 
the 
stern 
of 
the 
Beduin 
Three 
\
of 
the 
men 
stripped 
to 
the 
loincloth 
, 
and 
each 
rabbed 
a 
shoup 
and 
walked 
\
into 
the 
river 
to 
wash 
it 
while 
the 
children 
and 
the 
fourth 
man 
keep 
the 
rest 
\
of 
the 
flock 
together 
and 
one 
small 
naked 
hoy 
wrestled 
with 
a 
ram 
It 
was 
a 
\
very 
Interesting 
sight 
and 
I 
was 
so 
annoyed 
when 
the 
native 
policeman 
whit 
\
spends 
his 
day 
over 
here 
to 
see 
that 
no 
one 
steals 
our 
tuckers 
strolled 
up 
\
and 
ordered 
them 
away 
from 
the 
gutted 
precincts 
of 
the 
databya 
Band 
\
Cousin 
Theodore 
rode 
over 
to 
the 
diggings 
and 
I 
went 
for 
a 
long 
\
walk 
. 
My 
Monday 
attempt 
proved 
that 
my 
leg 
is 
still 
too 
lume 
for 
riding 
\
Away 
to 
the 
north 
, 
standing 
in 
how 
in 
the 
most 
of 
would 
and 
\
baltic 
name 
With 
the 
for 
one 
of 
The 
Kansas 
Tracks 
name 
are 
\
three 
palm 
trees 
They 
look 
exactly 
like 
the 
funny 
pictures 
of 
the 
African 
\
desert 
with 
an 
artist 
up 
in 
one 
of 
them 
while 
a 
tion 
lashes 
his 
fail 
in 
front 
\
of 
a 
deserted 
case 
below 
. 
Cousin 
Emma 
says 
the 
has 
hated 
those 
palm 
trees 
\
for 
years 
, 
and 
even 
I 
have 
got 
deadly 
tired 
of 
thein 
this 
winter 
. 
So 
I 
\
walked 
to 
theal 
to 
see 
if 
I 
liked 
them 
better 
at 
close 
range 
. 
The 
first 
part 
\
of 
the 
walk 
led 
airing 
the 
sands 
by 
the 
river's 
edge 
where 
the 
natives 
are 
\
planning 
their 
links 
with 
short 
bunches 
\
of 
dry 
cane 
in 
them 
to 
keep 
the 
sand 
together 
show 
where 
melons 
love 
abeady 
\
been 
planted 
, 
and 
little 
oblong 
bunches 
about 
the 
size 
of 
a 
large 
\
watermelon 
, 
show 
where 
others 
are 
to 
be 
planted 
There 
ought 
to 
be 
an 
\
enormous 
crop 
in 
this 
isonediate 
vicinily 
alone 
. 
Then 
I 
struck 
inland 
past 
a 
\
native 
village 
which 
has 
always 
looked 
so 
charming 
in 
the 
ridge 
broken 
by 
\
shadufs 
and 
distance 
and 
which 
was 
very 
squalld 
really 
does 
litle 
while 
\
broken 
by 
shades 
and 
i 
the 
complaining 
satch 
around 
which 
a 
cow 
\
toiled 
I 
like 
Camels 
always 
look 
so 
\
absolutely 
superior 
to 
anything 
they 
may 
be 
doing 
. 
I 
heard 
such 
a 
nice 
\
reason 
the 
other 
day 
for 
the 
superciliousness 
of 
the 
camel 
. 
Allah 
Las 
one 
\
hundred 
names 
- 
the 
\b \cf3 Eruitful \b0 \cf2 
know 
ninety 
nine 
of 
them 
but 
the 
\
caine 
baum's 
the 
hundredth 
. 
Then 
I 
cut 
across 
a 
cultivated 
linde 
guilty 
\
climbed 
up 
the 
other 
side 
and 
behold 
the 
three 
freon 
, 
looking 
quite 
\
love 
and 
presiding 
over 
the 
very 
verdant 
outskirts 
of 
a 
tiny 
village 
I 
came 
\
back 
another 
way 
and 
was 
ready 
for 
quarts 
of 
tea 
when 
I 
got 
here 
\
\b \cf3 Eriday \b0 \cf2 
\b \cf3 EebruaryI \b0 \cf2 
And 
our 
last 
day 
bere 
whi 
we 
stop 
on 
our 
way 
during 
\
to 
Cairo 
I 
we 
across 
to 
Luxor 
this 
morning 
to 
say 
good 
- 
bye 
to 
Mrs. 
\
Pier 
and 
have 
a 
final 
scalp 
treatment 
. 
The 
tonic 
they 
apply 
is 
made 
, 
they 
\
say 
from 
the 
juice 
of 
the 
palm 
tree 
. 
This 
morning 
when 
the 
German 
youth 
who 
\
has 
had 
recent 
charge 
of 
my 
sparse 
tresses 
dabbed 
on 
said 
tonic 
, 
I 
exclaimed 
\
Oh 
that 
stings 
, 
" 
" 
\b \cf3 es \b0 \cf2 
, 
madain 
it 
is

\
was 
his 
apt 
rejoinder 
\
diggings 
at 
Medinet 
fabul 
for 
weeks 
When 
we 
\
announced 
we 
were 
going 
Cousin 
I 
said 
he 
did 
not 
wish 
us 
to 
as 
we 
would 
\
interfere 
with 
the 
work 
. 
He 
and 
Doris 
go 
over 
every 
other 
day 
, 
but 
when 
we 
\
suggest 
going 
he 
seems 
to 
think 
that 
our 
presence 
will 
block 
everything 
We 
\
took 
the 
felucca 
and 
rowed 
down 
to 
the 
ferry 
landing 
where 
a 
carnage 
with 
two 
\
mules 
wailed 
us 
and 
I 
was 
internally 
much 
amused 
when 
Cousin 
Emma 
gave 
the 
\
driver 
the 
simple 
order 
" 
Medine 
Habu 
for 
the 
\b \cf3 valley \b0 \cf2 
of 
the 
\b \cf3 ueens \b0 \cf2 
was 
\
supposed 
to 
be 
our 
object 
. 
But 
we 
were 
crazy 
to 
see 
she 
things 
Harry 
hed 
\
excavated 
since 
our 
last 
visit 
- 
amely 
the 
palace 
of 
\b \cf3 amses \b0 \cf2 
Ill 
. 
We 
found 
\
arry 
trying 
to 
take 
a 
photo 
graph 
, 
while 
his 
hundred 
boys 
and 
men 
\
proceeded 
on 
their 
endless 
procession 
to 
the 
dumping 
place 
. 
The 
throne 
room 
\
and 
three 
bathroo 
is 
ace 
what 
have 
thus 
far 
een 
brought 
to 
light 
. 
As 
\
the 
bathrooms 
open 
directly 
off 
the 
throne 
room 
to 
the 
casual 
and 
frivolous 
\
ove 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
the 
king 
divided 
his 
time 
between 
sitting 
on 
his 
throne 
\
and 
a 
- 
washing 
of 
Hisself 
. 
On 
our 
way 
to 
our 
carriage 
we 
were 
held 
\
up 
by 
a 
native 
who 
produced 
bandana 
tied 
up 
in 
A 
wad 
from 
which 
he 
took 
out 
\
four 
file 
arved 
bone 
images 
which 
he 
told 
us 
. 
in 
a 
scared 
whisper, 
\
came 
from 
Lord 
Curmarvin's 
diggings 
Cousin 
\b \cf3 Eroma \b0 \cf2 
wished 
to 
buy 
them 
to 
\
Doris 
, 
but 
had 
forgotten 
her 
purse 
. 
The 
man 
agreed 
to 
take 
the 
entire 
\
contents 
of 
mine 
, 
though 
it 
fell 
short 
of 
the 
ten 
shillings 
he 
asked 
. 
When 
\
too 
late 
we 
realized 
that 
this 
transaction 
loft 
us 
with 
no 
backshis 
for 
\
anybody 
. 
On 
we 
went 
to 
the 
\b \cf3 valley \b0 \cf2 
of 
the 
\b \cf3 ueens \b0 \cf2 
- 
a 
lovely 
desert 
drive, 
\
and 
my 
eye 
a 
much 
happier 
valley 
than 
that 
of 
the 
Kings 
, 
because 
of 
the 
\
wide 
and 
beautiful 
view 
from 
upon 
being 
upon 
bette 
controlled 
by 
\
the 
game 
, 
the 
\
remembered 
we'd 
of 
our 
passes 
at 
home 
but 
the 
\
magic 
name 
of 
Davis 
opened 
the 
way 
. 
But 
then 
we 
fell 
back 
in 
the 
carriage 
\
explaining 
we 
had 
backshis 
Brand 
smiles 
on 
the 
face 
of 
the 
gather 
\
and 
courteous 
Assurance 
that 
that 
made 
no 
difference 
. 
I 
wanted 
mainly 
to 
\
see 
the 
tomb 
of 
Nefertan 
so 
I 
went 
into 
that 
and 
if 
that 
\b \cf3 ueen \b0 \cf2 
was 
as 
lovely 
\
as 
her 
pictures 
on 
those 
walls 
\b \cf3 amses \b0 \cf2 
II 
must 
have 
been 
crazy 
About 
her 
The 
\
drive 
back 
to 
the 
river 
was 
enchanting 
- 
the 
air 
so 
fresh 
so 
calm 
, 
so 
\
scented 
, 
the 
bailey 
fields 
such 
a 
rejoicing 
green 
everything 
so 
beautiful 
\
in 
the 
ecstatic 
light 
of 
afternoon 
. 
The 
river 
cached 
, 
no 
backshis 
for 
the 
\
driver 
, 
but 
he 
was 
quite 
satisfied 
when 
we 
told 
him 
Mr 
. 
Jones 
would 
tend 
\
to 
that 
( 
Jones 
is 
almost 
as 
much 
a 
name 
to 
conjure 
by 
as 
Davis 
. 
Also 
\
there 
was 
to 
felucca 
we 
having 
forgotten 
to 
tell 
it 
when 
to 
come 
back 
for 
us 
\
A 
Winter 
Palace 
boat 
clamored 
for 
the 
linor 
of 
taking 
us 
to 
our 
databya 
\
brutally 
pushing 
aside 
he 
lone 
tourist 
wishing 
to 
cross 
to 
said 
Palace. 
\
Just 
started 
in 
the 
Winter 
Palace 
boat, 
up 
dashed 
our 
own 
felucca 
, 
the 
man 
\
mowing 
like 
mad 
and 
we 
were 
transferred 
the 
Winter 
Palace 
boatmen 
effectly 
\
satisfied 
when 
we 
said 
Mr 
. 
Jones 
would 
see 
them 
. 
The 
sstole 
expedition 
was 
\
awful 
Saturday 
On 
our 
way 
up 
the 
\b \cf3 iver \b0 \cf2 
. 
We 
hit 
the 
wail 
( 
\
as 
we 
used 
to 
say 
in 
my 
beloved 
wild 
west 
\b \cf3 [DELETED: )] \b0 \cf2
at 
\b \cf3 I \b0 \cf2 
\b \cf3 Ix \b0 \cf2 
this 
morning 
, 
and 
it 
\
was 
high 
time 
for 
us 
to 
be 
moving 
, 
for 
Cousin 
Theodore 
was 
getting 
tired 
of 
\
Luster 
and 
low 
in 
his 
mind 
And 
again 
Doris 
and 
I 
are 
in 
the 
clutch 
of 
\
the 
database 
of 
these 
mandated 
shores 
supplies 
by 
evenbody 
is 
\
planes 
wouldride 
on 
the 
sandburg 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
river 
. 
I 
should 
\
think 
that 
later 
on 
the 
entice 
population 
would 
be 
writhing 
with 
colic 
\
I 
don't 
know 
just 
where 
this 
will 
be 
posted 
but 
it 
will 
seize 
its 
first 
\
appartunity 
Much 
much 
love 
on 
you 
al 
The 
Nile 
, 
\
Somewhere 
above 
Ed 
Dearest 
Adeline 
. 
If 
the 
frogs 
made 
as 
much 
\
noise 
in 
Pharoah's 
bedroom 
as 
they 
are 
making 
outside 
of 
mine 
tonight 
I 
wonder 
\
he 
did 
not 
let 
the 
people 
go 
sooner 
. 
I 
never 
heard 
anything 
like 
Ind 
\
just 
this 
minute 
the 
voice 
of 
a 
jacket 
was 
added 
to 
the 
row 
that 
has 
been 
\
going 
on 
every 
second 
since 
\b \cf3 Mx \b0 \cf2 
- 
it 
now 
being 
half 
past 
ton 
\
\b \cf3 esterday \b0 \cf2 
, 
after 
I 
finished 
my 
letter 
to 
you 
, 
we 
had 
an 
excitement 
. 
We 
\
were 
going 
through 
the 
great 
bridge 
at 
Each 
when 
our 
tay 
made 
too 
sharp 
a 
\
hunt 
before 
the 
dahabya 
got 
clear 
of 
the 
mendous 
piers 
or 
buttresses 
or 
\
whatever 
they 
are 
called 
Everybody 
up 
above 
on 
the 
bridge 
our 
\
transit 
began 
to 
jump 
and 
yell 
, 
the 
crew 
Dying 
up 
on 
deck 
like 
the 
\
wind 
and 
leaped 
the 
eats 
on 
the 
failing 
to 
try 
to 
push 
us 
o 
gres 
ve 
mulder 
\
and 
dashed 
against 
the 
burito 
Second 
Captain 
Mahomnied 
as 
he 
Hung 
his 
\
whole 
weight 
on 
his 
tiller 
looked 
like 
a 
raging 
devil 
and 
undoubtedly 
has 
\
one 
inside 
of 
himself 
There 
was 
not 
much 
damage 
done 
. 
some 
paint 
amoved 
and 
\
a 
few 
splinters 
, 
but 
that 
was 
all 
And 
none 
of 
the 
crew 
hurt 
- 
to 
our 
great 
\
relief 
thought 
one 
man 
was 
going 
to 
be 
washed 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
afternoon's 
\
voyage 
" 
up 
south 
" 
as 
they 
say 
in 
this 
land 
of 
contradictions 
\
procee 
in 
peace 
with 
such 
exquisite 
beauty 
round 
about 
us 
that 
I 
wished 
I 
\
had 
been 
constructed 
" 
full 
of 
eyes 
before 
and 
behind 
like 
the 
Beast 
in 
\
\b \cf3 evelations \b0 \cf2 
and 
color 
filled 
the 
very 
alt 
- 
like 
hustle. 
\
One 
new 
feature 
in 
the 
landscape 
was 
the 
stockade 
like 
structures 
made 
of 
\
dry 
stalks 
stalks 
of 
the 
cahuita 
\b \cf3 c \b0 \cf2 
fancy 
put 
down 
along 
the 
sunny 
side 
of 
\
the 
shadufs 
to 
protect 
the 
workers 
a 
little 
Down 
the 
glare 
. 
We 
must 
have 
\
passed 
hundreds 
of 
shaders 
yesterday 
and 
today 
ng 
the 
\
heard 
a 
piece 
of 
the 
bank 
detach 
itself 
with 
They 
\
must 
weaken 
the 
back 
greatly 
others 
oppos 
i 
do 
today 
\
so 
that 
Don's 
and 
I 
might 
a 
boom 
like 
a 
cannon 
and 
drop 
into 
the 
Mile 
see 
the 
\
temple 
. 
We 
started 
this 
morning 
from 
our 
tying 
up 
place 
( 
the 
other 
side 
\
of 
El 
\b \cf3 Kab \b0 \cf2 
before 
sunrise 
but 
ran 
on 
to 
a 
sandbar 
and 
were 
much 
delayed, 
\
and 
it 
was 
luncheon 
time 
when 
we 
reached 
Elle 
As 
soon 
as 
we 
had 
leached 
Dor's 
\
and 
blasted 
climbing 
ver 
sleep 
and 
dusty 
scoop 
and 
dusty 
back, 
\
covered 
with 
chicken 
feathers 
at 
the 
top 
of 
which 
donkeys 
were 
\
managed 
to 
always 
have 
donkeys 
or 
carriages 
read 
for 
us 
I 
\
don't 
know 
, 
but 
it 
always 
in 
It's 
Jones 
, 
I 
suppose 
. 
Beside 
the 
usual 
\
fout 
escort 
of 
donkey 
boys 
and 
a 
sat 
or 
we 
had 
a 
mounted 
boo 
consisting 
of 
\
\b \cf3 Eanzen \b0 \cf2 
and 
a 
native 
policemen 
. 
There 
was 
nothing 
attractive 
about 
the 
ride 
\
, 
which 
look 
only 
len 
or 
fifteen 
minutes 
and 
the 
heat 
was 
fierce 
But 
the 
\
temple 
is 
perfectly 
winning 
\b \cf3 [DELETED: ;] \b0 \cf2
probably 
the 
best 
preserved 
erved 
ancient 
\
monument 
in 
the 
world 
, 
Bacdecker 
says 
The 
gator 
who 
showed 
us 
over 
\
the 
temple 
explained 
that 
its 
excellent 
state 
was 
due 
to 
its 
being 
ling 
\
from 
\b \cf3 IxI \b0 \cf2 
B 
C 
. 
In 
one 
of 
the 
ten 
small 
chambers 
opening 
from 
\
the 
corridor 
surrounding 
the 
Sanctuary 
is 
a 
granite 
sacrificial 
stone 
and 
he 
\
told 
us 
a 
tale 
concerning 
it 
which 
we 
can 
find 
in 
none 
of 
the 
guide 
books. 
\
He 
said 
that 
upon 
that 
stone 
were 
slain 
such 
people 
as 
were 
unfortunate 
enough 
\
to 
have 
one 
not 
of 
hair 
among 
the 
cushy 
on 
man 
" 
\
he 
said 
. 
We 
saw 
the 
Nilometer 
outside 
the 
temple 
and 
we 
\
climbed 
to 
the 
roof 
of 
the 
temple 
, 
Where 
it 
was 
hotter 
than 
pepper 
but 
\
the 
view 
from 
which 
made 
it 
quite 
worth 
while 
The 
donkey 
I 
code 
was 
the 
most 
\
heavenly 
animal 
I've 
ever 
been 
on 
- 
a 
big 
handsome 
grey 
Sudanese 
donkey 
with 
\
a 
gait 
in 
smooth 
he 
hardly 
seemed 
to 
be 
moving 
I 
would 
like 
nothing 
\
better 
than 
to 
buy 
land 
and 
take 
him 
home 
. 
Conventions 
are 
such 
deadly 
\
stupid 
things 
- 
Doris 
and 
\b \cf3 oger \b0 \cf2 
would 
almost 
as 
soon 
have 
me 
dead 
as 
to 
see 
me 
\
riding 
about 
New 
Haven 
on 
a 
donkey 
covered 
with 
red 
tassels 
and 
yet 
it 
would 
\
give 
me 
such 
keen 
pleasure 
and 
be 
such 
pleasant 
Moderate 
exercise 
. 
We 
got 
\
back 
to 
the 
bedwin 
at 
three 
and 
proceeded 
upon 
our 
lovely 
watery 
\
March 
\b \cf3 I \b0 \cf2 
To 
has 
been 
a 
perfectly 
bored 
day 
will 
a 
lovely 
ending 
to 
it 
and 
\
just 
one 
Peasant 
incident 
in 
the 
hamid 
part 
to 
sooner 
had 
we 
started 
this 
\
morning 
than 
we 
stuck 
on 
sandbar 
- 
that 
is 
our 
tug 
stuck 
. 
As 
the 
Beduin 
\
draws 
only 
If 
inches 
of 
water 
she 
never 
sticks 
on 
anything 
. 
When 
we 
finally 
\
got 
off 
there 
were 
five 
other 
boats 
( 
native 
ones 
- 
high 
and 
dry 
on 
the 
\
same 
but 
It 
was 
a 
grey 
morning 
and 
the 
air 
heavy 
and 
enervating 
As 
we 
went 
\
through 
the 
gorge 
of 
Silsilal 
we 
had 
an 
excellent 
view 
of 
the 
rock 
- 
hewn 
\
chapel 
of 
lorem 
- 
bob 
with 
its 
five 
doors 
an 
that 
curious 
row 
of 
shrines 
\
also 
rock 
- 
hown 
with 
the 
figures 
in 
them 
looking 
as 
Miss 
Edwards 
says 
\
In 
her 
Thousand 
Miles 
up 
the 
Nice 
like 
people 
sitting 
in 
opera 
hikes 
And 
\
then 
a 
perfectly 
dreadful 
wind 
blew 
up 
and 
lashed 
the 
river 
into 
a 
fury 
of 
\
waves 
and 
whitecaps 
and 
the 
air 
was 
full 
of 
sand 
and 
the 
landscape 
was 
more 
\
or 
less 
blotted 
out 
and 
every 
bit 
of 
energy 
evaporated 
from 
me 
At 
about 
one 
\
we 
tied 
up 
just 
above 
Kum 
Onwu 
, 
but 
because 
Doris 
and 
I 
were 
to 
see 
the 
\
temple 
, 
and 
also 
because 
navigation 
was 
the 
disagreeable 
There 
is 
a 
bank 
\
towering 
above 
us 
here 
where 
we 
lied 
, 
and 
though 
the 
Bedouin 
jerked 
and 
\
of 
the 
afternoon 
, 
we 
were 
out 
of 
the 
direct 
path 
of 
the 
wind 
\
Doris 
and 
I 
decided 
to 
wait 
till 
after 
ten 
before 
going 
to 
the 
temple 
in 
\
hopes 
that 
the 
wind 
would 
fall 
- 
which 
it 
did 
. 
The 
one 
pleasant 
\
incident 
above 
referred 
to 
was 
a 
visit 
from 
a 
tiny 
black 
kid 
with 
long 
\
flopping 
whit 
ears 
. 
He 
announced 
himself 
with 
some 
baby 
beats 
and 
then 
\
trotted 
across 
the 
gangplank 
on 
to 
him 
and 
\
he 
liked 
us 
so 
much 
that 
he 
kept 
coming 
back 
in 
time 
the 
sailors 
herded 
lut 
\
off 
the 
gang 
plank 
to 
the 
shore 
Net 
ten 
Don's 
and 
I 
Look 
Tuneen 
and 
a 
\
sailor 
, 
climbed 
the 
bank 
, 
and 
two 
minutes 
walk 
along 
the 
top 
of 
it 
brought 
\
us 
so 
the 
The 
hour 
we 
spent 
there 
put 
us 
in 
tune 
again 
It

\
wow

last 
\
thing 
we 
saw 
on 
entering 
the 
forecast 
was 
a 
little 
chapel 
in 
one 
room 
of 
\
high 
of 
le 
have

He 
shuddery 
. 
The 
temple 
is 
\
le 
is 
very 
ninons 
, 
and 
the 
of 
carved 
over 
every 
\
from 
the 
pure 
, 
conventional 
lines 
of 
the 
host

and 
go

in 
for

with 
a 
result 
that 
is 
tothe

and 
wopleasant 
I's 
cover 
\
glory 
our 
eyes 
is 
its 
site 
- 
directly 
on 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
Mile 
on 
the 
summit 
\
of 
a 
bank 
so 
lofty 
that 
it 
would 
be 
a 
cliff 
if 
it 
were 
of 
rock 
, 
but 
being 
of 
\
earth 
, 
has 
had 
to 
be 
strongly 
reinforced 
to 
keep 
the 
whole 
temple 
from 
\
gradually 
washing 
away 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
inundation 
. 
The 
views 
from 
the 
\
interior 
out 
through 
the 
splendid 
columbus, 
of 
the 
lives 
and 
the 
limitless 
\
desert 
beyond 
are 
a 
wonder 
and 
joy 
. 
We 
climbed 
for 
up 
on 
a 
ruined 
puton 
\
and 
sat 
there 
there 
watching 
the 
gleaming 
river 
for 
below 
the 
Wisteria 
tint 
\
spreading 
over 
the 
sands 
of 
an 
island 
now 
void 
of 
the 
crocodiles 
that 
once 
\
infested 
line 
of 
people 
going 
home 
to 
a 
vilage 
on 
the 
far 
shore, 
\
and 
then 
the 
sun 
sinking 
behind 
the 
be 
able 
to 
root

for

\
flamed 
into 
splendor 
. 
Somehow 
it 
all 
made 
me 
think 
of 
" 
the 
glory 
that 
\
was 
Career 
quite 
as 
much 
as 
of
