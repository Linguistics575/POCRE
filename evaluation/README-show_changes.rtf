\f0\fs24 \cf0 A program to show where a hypothesis text (such as the output from an OCR correction system) differs from a reference text (such as the raw OCR'd text). \
\
# Input\
The hypothesis and reference text files, in plain text format (.txt). It is assumed that the files have line-by-line correspondence (line breaks are the same).\
\
# Output \
The hypothesis text with changes shown in red. Words that appear in the reference text but not in the hypothesis text are preceded by "DELETED: "\

To run from the command line: \
* Make sure you have python installed. (You can check by opening your command line utility (Terminal for Macs, Command Prompt for Windows) and typing "python".) \
* Navigate to the directory that contains the show_changes.py file.\
* Run the following command:\
'''\
python show_changes.py single path/reference_file.txt path/hypothesis_file.txt > output_file.txt\
'''\
\
# NOTE\
This process will eventually be incorporated into the OCR correction system itself so comparing system output to system input will happen automatically and running this script separately won't be necessary.}
