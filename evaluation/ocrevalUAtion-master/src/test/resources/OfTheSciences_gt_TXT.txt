2, Of the Sciences in general.  
in, with continual labour, he hath
exerciſed the ſtrength and vigour of his Ingenuity or Invention. But
I, perſwa-  ded by reaſons of another nature, do verily believe,
that  there is nothing more pernicious, nothing more de- ſtructive to
the well-being of Men, or to the Salvation  of our Souls, than the Arts
and Sciences themſelves. And therefore quite contrary to what has

Chriſtianity, but would ra- ther ſhew me to be a vain purſuer of
flattery and oſten-  tation, while I endeavour to varniſh my Speech
with  the Fucus's of Eloquence. For to ſpeak Properly, not
 Rhetorically, to intend the truth of the Matter, not the ornament
of Language, is the duty of one profeſſing Sacred Literature. For the
Seat of Truth is not in the Tongue, but in the Heart. Neither is it of
importance, what
