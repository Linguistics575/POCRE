For two sentences of length l1 and l2 respectively (number of words) the
indel distance dI and the number delta of differences are related by:

dI = abs(l1 - l2) + delta
On the other hand, the number of errors is
n = abs(l1 - l2) + delta 
and therefore
n = 0.5 * (abs(1 - l2) + dI)

WER is the n normalized to the length l1 of the reference sentence.
Case is folded for WER (case insensitive)

CER is computed as the Levenshtein distance dL normalized to the length l1
(number of characters) of the reference file.

BWER is the bag of words based WER, that is irrespective of word order (for
example if reading order of text regions has been incorrectly established).
Obviously, BWER <= WER.
 
Remark:  WER, BWER and CER, as defined here, can be larger than one.
