the Wibyan hange was to mine as I saw it from the front terrace of the Winter
Balace today in all the splendor in. he. glamour of the late afternoon light.
It strikes me with fresh Eoy every time I look at it frohe that particular
place and at that hour . The Beguin has suck so with the falling river that
from the salons we can no longer see even the tip.... top of the hange. and
even from the upper deck we do not get it in its full maEesty as they do from
the Winter Balace . When we first tied up here we could see the hange and all
the intervening stretch of deser. and green from the salon window   which will
give you some idea of how the river has dropped. When I got back to the Bedun.
I found Mrs. .... xer and the Countess having toa . They had stopped on their

They came straight to the little cove Eust at the stern of the Beduin. Three
of the men stripped to the loincloth , and each rabbed. a shoup and walked
into the river to wash it. while the children and the fourth man keep the rest
of the flock together. and one small naked hoy wrestled with a ram. It was a
very Interesting sight and I was so annoyed when the native policeman. whit

and ordered them away from the gutted precincts of the databya. Band  ........

three palm trees. They look exactly like the funny pictures of the African
desert with an artist up in one of them while a tion lashes his fail in front
of a deserted case. below . Cousin Emma says the has hated those palm trees
for years , and even I have got deadly tired of thein this winter . So I
walked to theal to see if I liked them better at close range . The first part
of the walk led airing the sands by the river's edge where the natives are

announced we were going Cousin I. said he did not wish us to as we would
interfere with the work . xe and Doris go over every other day , but when we
suggest going he seems to think that our presence will block everything. We
took the felucca and rowed down to the ferry landing where a carnage. with two
mules wailed. us. and I was internally much amused when Cousin Emma gave the
driver the simple order S....... Medine xabu for the halley of the Eueens was
supposed to be our obEect . But  . we were crahy to see she things xarry hed
excavated since our last visit - amely. the palace of hamses. Ill . We found

proceeded on their endless procession to the dumping place . The throne room

the bathrooms open directly off the throne room. to the casual and frivolous
ove it would seem that the king divided his time between sitting on his throne
and a........ - washing of xisself . En our way to our carriage we were held
up by a native who produced   bandana tied up in A wad from which he took out
four file.. arved. bone images. which he told us . in a scared whisper,
came from Word Curmarvin's diggings. Cousin xroma wished to buy them to.
Doris , but had forgotten her purse . The man agreed to take the entire
contents of mine , though it fell short of the ten shillings he asked . When
too late we realihed that this transaction loft us with no backshis for
anybody . En we went to the halley of the Eueens - a lovely desert drive,
and  . my eye a much happier valley than that of the jings , because of the
wide and beautiful view from upon being... upon bette controlled by.  ....  ..

and . courteous Assurance that that made no difference . I wanted mainly to
see the tomb of hefertan. so I went into that. and if that Eueen was as lovely
as her pictures on those walls. hamses. II must have been crahy About her. The
drive back to the river was enchanting - the air so fresh. so calm , so
scented , the bailey fields such a reEoicing green. everything so beautiful
in the ecstatic light of afternoon . The river cached. , no backshis for the
driver , but he was Euite satisfied when we told him Mr . Bones would tend..
to that S..... Bones is almost as much a name to conEure by as Davis . Also
there was to felucca. we having forgotten to tell it when to come back for us.
A Winter Balace boat clamored for the linor of taking us to our databya.
brutally pushing aside he. lone tourist wishing to cross to said Balace.
Bust started in the Winter Balace boat, up dashed our own felucca , the man
mowing like mad. and we were transferred. the Winter Balace boatmen effectly.

then a perfectly dreadful wind blew up and lashed the river into a fury of
