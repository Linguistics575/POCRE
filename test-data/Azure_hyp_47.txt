huroughly enjoy belonging to the conquering and superior races I hate to
have silong poor tooffensive people pushed off the public highway in order
to give me three times more room than Thursday March 13 Vas Hamadi
It has been a perfectly hateful day - with the wind blow erybody
off the face of the earth We tied up here in the middle of the day
because it was too dangerous to go through the dramatize in such a sala mis
s cold and glittering night . The May lower , presumably with Mor
Weston on board is lying on the other side of the river , waiting for the
opening of the bridge in the morning Friday , March 14 . The Nile near
Giegale . This has been a great day - one of the best we've had in Egypt We
reached Beliana about cleven I think , and as soon as we could after that we
started for Abydos Dar's and Hansen on donkeys and Amelie and I in a
broushare ( of all things in the world to drive about Egypt in ) with a
coronet on the door Also there was a very gorgeous native policeman on a
proud Arabian but prancing beside us they may belane is a very bad town .
and somehow it looked it . The eight mile drive to Abydes is through such
beautify country . As you leave the town there seem to be great estates on
either side with fine palm hen come vast fields of grain , green And
golden , and reaped and stacked and many Hooks and lords , and the abodes
of the tribes leading thein are out in the broad fat topped stacks of grain!
And there was in mich joyous young life bounding and cavorting about On the
highway baby donkeys , baby camels , baby calves and kids and
lambs . The temple of Celi I Abydos is an unded by hills of rubbish
that it has the effect of being a sunken one , and the Gocade is so very
ruinous that the splendors of the interior we all the more striking , the
most beautiful carving it seemed to us that we've seen in Egypt We found a
Cook's party of about we promptly had ours , beginning twenty - Gue having luncheon in the
lomia and being starring we promptly had ours bos with a libation to
the gods as Ifantes dropped the water
delightful wandering shout the temple So much of the mot is gone that much
of the place basks in sunlight We did not go to the other temple - that of
Ramses II . because it is a very inferior one , and we didn't want to take
too much time As we were leaving the onslaught of natives with things to
sell and natives who only wanted to her and everybody yelling at once , and
their Vanquishing by Amelie reminded me of a verse in the Paling " They came
about me like thes were extinct even as Gre among thoms " Again we
had the delights of the drive , matted only by a tearing wind Once our house
shed violently at a Bedin riding by on a camel in the doop ditch by the high
road . Our driver explained that the horse disliked the Beduin headdress
our Beduin on the road by the river we had to make our way through
trains of camels laden with bags of onions which were being unloaded from
thiassas ( I don't know how to spell them , but they are the native boats
with the Viking pen is and enormous ani's ) We got back in ample time to
pull up stakes and make some headway before nightall Saturday March 15
That above Abutis It's been another day spoiled by a tearing wind which
destroys all the pleasure of being on deck Early this morning before we were
up we passed Cook's Steamer Amenartis on her way to Aswan , with Family and
Marian Whitney on board . I'm so sorry to have missed them at Luz s . We
have passed Alterim a very lary and flourishing native town , to which ,
according to tradition a heathen princess once came rising to desecrate a
temple , and the earth opened and swallowed her up The most beautiful sight
today was why looked like the preparing of a caravan to go somewhere into the
interior - camels were being loaded with all kinds of strange things and the
ringling of colors was quite ravishing We are getting into the land of
colored raiment again instead of the black and white of upper Egypt Good
bye , dears , much love
Your devoted Mary
