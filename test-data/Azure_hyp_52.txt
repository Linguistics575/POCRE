think in a way that is the most amazing sight I've seen in Egypt Those
enormous subterranean passages , those incredible titanic sarcophas of
granite the inconceivable labor and ingenuity of it all in order that the
sacred bulls should be fittingly buried Certainly they were an extraordinary
people , those ancients of Egypt We finished our sightseeing with the tomb
of This , where I got so tired that I began to think of the back of my camel
as a haven of rest . Then we mounted , had our photographs taken , and
turned out faces homeward It took us just two hours to return and When we got
to Mong House at six we drank quarts of tea . We asked the waiter when the
next train would leave for Cairo and he replied " The next train has gone !
" So we telephoned for motor and got back just in time to dress for our
eight o'clock dinner . The wonders of Sakkara are ery grout , but in my
memory the chief glory of today will always be that enchanting ride over the
desert under that vast vast sky of triumphant blue with heaped up masses of
snowy cloud , the sweet , wild wind in our faces and the effects of light
and of drizing cloud - shadow Wings indescribable beauty Afall Cousin
Theo dare had such a dreadful tooth this morning that I took him to
the dentist's and had it out He suffered an horribly a ago because he
didn't have a tooth nut , thi we didn't delay is on this occasion for fear
he would change his mind the news of Mor ? Morgan's death came this
morning Cairo is bursting into bloom as befits the time of your . The

place that is a dream of beauty . I think it's a kind of magnolia a very

the great pleasure of having Emily and Marian Whitney to ten . It was so nice
to see them . We had ted in the great hell which was once the scene of an
atrocious time . This palace was the one Ismail built for the Empress
Eugenic to occupy at the opening of the Suez Canal After that he led it for
one of his own royal abodes . He led a foster brother who was supposed to be
his closest friend and his dearest one . Ile took him to drive one day and on
their return as they entered the great hall guards seized the foster brother
and killed him there While that unspeakable beast , Ismail strolled up the
marble staircase as though nothing were happening . After tea Mc Hine ,
the manager , took us through the Casino . It is so unattractive on the
outside that I had never blew the trouble to do in litle imagining the
splendor of the interior Putit seems to was part of the royal later and
many of the old Us are still there and it is really regal After
we'd seen that I got a HA Ha to the Beguin as they
never had seen said they found it
even more interesting than a royal Wednesday
