During the last week in Cairo there was a little social flavoring mixed in
with shopping sightseeing and the daily round . I lunched one day with the
Contessa and Mr . Tremayne at the Continental , and Mr . Tremayne
pulling jus lan Hus land in his jacket and pulling out a little wad of Tired paper said
" Hero , Mrs . Newberry is an antique I've been carrying about for weeks
meaning i've you " and there was a heavenly bit of the perfect Egyptian blue
with the sacred aye or Horus on it - the very thing I had hunted for in vain
in the shops at Luxe I've had it set in a ring and it's fascinating Various
people came to call among them Watson Pasha , a Personage indood in Fayps
being the Khedive's one English aide . I was out the afternoon he came but I
met him a day or two after at a toa at the Grahames and found him a most
delightful person . Lean and tanned and simple and direct and amusing . So
tanned that it it were not for the clear out alcan English features he might
easily have been taken for a native . The King of Siam did take him for one
The had been sent meet that potentate and escort him through the Suez Canal
Major Watson was wearing the uniform of the Egyptian Army and as His Majesty
of Siam shook hands with him he said " I hope it is perhaps that you speak a
few words of English . As be told me this scary he was taking his amber
cigarette holder from a gold case . " That is the most simplybus thing I
ever saw " I said Wait ! said he and brought out a gold civarelle case
and a gold matchbox " Backshish " he explained , " They can't give me
money so they give me these things and I'd so much rather have a check for a
thousand pounds The Grillames place is one of the sweetest I've ever seen ,

then wherever they go We had lea on the veranda and black and grey crows
were waiting close by until we should turn our backs to steal the cakes Our
last evening in Cairo was a dream of healey with the tenderest thread of a
hey mow floating above a towering auratzia in the garden . The Cheque
people must have been glad to have us go - they'd been keeping the hotel open
just for ins and closed it when we left . Sir Backder , the manager of
Shepheard's and the Chearch his own motorcar to help convey us to the
station as a parting compliment to Cousin Theodore . Various people were at
the station to focus of including seven of the crew of the Begun al
there were of in calls the others having scattered They all shook all our
hands see separate times and my friend Mohammed , the second captain
looked perfectly superb . We left Cairo at 9:45 and for three hours and a
quart our train sped through lovely scenes . We sailed at two that
afternoon and the infinite boredom of seafaring has soaked to the marrow of my
bones . There are a lot of awfully good looking man on board and if I knew
some of them it might relieve my canus . but the voyage is too short for
making acquaintances . There are three Les Alleases one of whom has a face
like a Japanese ask and blows his nose so deafeningly and of that I'm it
constant fear that Cousin Theodore will speak to him about it . But the
Prince and Princess Radziwill I can't spell it look the quite

Concert while Cousin Theodore Doris and Harry were playing cards in the
smoking room . At a table near them sat the apanese Mask and the Radziwills
talking to each other in six different languages . The Japanese mask blew his
nose and Cousin Theodore branded in his chic , turned and glared at him and
said Good I leavens ! " in a loud voice . Then The Japanese mask began
spouting pages of Virgil that
