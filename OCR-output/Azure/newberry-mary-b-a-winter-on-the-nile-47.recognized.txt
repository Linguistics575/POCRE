remembering the rapture of the one up , has been a

We have today lost sight of the desert on the edge of which for three months we have lived in a
highly civilized and luxurious way - minus of course , the things that are supposed to go with

to make the bridge just before it closed after the morning opening . If we'd been ten minutes later
