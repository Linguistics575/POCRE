Friday February28 And our last day bere whi we stop on our way during to Cairo I we
across to Luxor this morning to say good - bye to Mrs . Pier and have a final scalp treatment . The
tonic they apply is made , they say from the juice of the palm tree . This morning when the
German youth who has had recent charge of my sparse tresses
dabbed on said tonic , I exclaimed
Oh that stings , " " Yes , madain it is do stink of do palm " was his apt rejoinder
diggings at Medinet fabul for weeks When we announced we were going Cousin I said he did
not wish us to as we would interfere with the work . He and Doris go over every other day , but
when we suggest going he seems to think that our presence will block everything We took the
felucca and rowed down to the ferry landing where a carnage with two mules wailed us and I
was internally much amused when Cousin Emma gave the driver the simple order " Medine
Habu for the Valley of the Queens was supposed to be our object . But we were crazy to see she
things Harry hed excavated since our last visit -
amely the palace of Ramses Ill . We found
arry trying to take a photo
graph , while his hundred boys and men proceeded on their endless
procession to the dumping place . The throne room and three bathroo
is ace what have thus far
een brought to light . As the bathrooms open directly off the throne room to the casual and
frivolous ove it would seem that the king divided his time between sitting on his throne and a -
washing of Hisself . On our way to our carriage we were held up by a native who produced
bandana tied up in A wad from which he took out four file
arved bone images which he told us .
in a scared whisper , came from Lord Curmarvin's
diggings Cousin Froma wished to buy them to
Doris , but had forgotten her purse . The man agreed to take the entire contents of mine , though it
fell short of the ten shillings he asked . When too late we realized that this transaction loft us with
no backshis for anybody . On we went to the Valley of the Queens - a lovely desert drive , and
my eye a much happier valley than that of the Kings , because of the wide and beautiful view from
upon being
upon bette controlled by the game , the remembered we'd of our passes at home but the magic
name of Davis opened the way . But then we fell back in the carriage explaining we had
backshis Brand smiles on the face of the gather and courteous Assurance that that made no
difference . I wanted mainly to see the tomb of Nefertan so I went into that and if that Queen
was as lovely as her pictures on those walls Ramses II must have been crazy About her
The drive back to the river was enchanting - the air so fresh so calm , so scented , the bailey fields
such a rejoicing green everything so beautiful in the ecstatic light of afternoon . The river
cached , no backshis for the driver , but he was quite satisfied when we told him Mr . Jones would
tend to that ( Jones is almost as much a name to conjure by as Davis . Also there was to felucca
we having forgotten to tell it when to come back for us
A Winter Palace boat clamored for the linor of taking us to our databya brutally pushing aside
he lone tourist wishing to cross to said Palace . Just started in the Winter Palace boat, up dashed
our own felucca , the man mowing like mad and we were transferred the Winter Palace boatmen
effectly satisfied when we said Mr . Jones would see them . The sstole expedition was awful
Saturday
On our way up the River . We hit the wail ( as we used to say in my beloved wild
west ) at 7:20 this morning , and it was high time for us to be moving , for Cousin Theodore was
getting tired of Luster and
low in his mind And again Doris and I are in the clutch of the
database of these mandated shores supplies by evenbody is planes wouldride on the
sandburg in the middle of the river . I should think that later on the entice population would be
writhing with colic
