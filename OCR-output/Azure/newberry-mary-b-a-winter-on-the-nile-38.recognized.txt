wonder if it's often given to human eyes to see anything more beautiful than the Libyan Range
was to mine as I saw it from the front terrace of the Winter Palace today in all the splendor in
he glamour of the late afternoon light It strikes me with fresh joy every time I look at it froze
that particular place and at that hour . The Beguin has suck so with the falling river that from the
salons we can no longer see even the tip top of the Range and even from the upper deck we do
not get it in its full majesty as they do from the Winter Palace . When we first tied up here we
could see the Range and all the intervening stretch of deser and green from the salon window
which will give you some idea of how the river has dropped
When I got back to the Bedun I found Mrs . Her and the Countess having toa . They had stopped
on their way home from an all day expedition to the Valey of the Tombs of the Apes They had
asked Don's and me to go , but vic declined because Cousin I was not feeling we
2 . This morning Cousin Ermine and nor's went over
Mohammed Mehassit and the Luxor temple etc . while Cousin Theodore and I settled ourselves
with the dominoes on deck . In the middle of a
the sound of many bicats eroge upon the air
ranging from deep paternal ones to ling
appealing baby bells and over the sands came block of
dark brown shoop with four men and some children shepherding them . They came straight to the
little cove just at the stern of the Beduin Three of the men stripped to the loincloth , and each
rabbed a shoup and walked into the river
to wash it while the children and the fourth man keep
the rest of the flock together and one small naked hoy wrestled with a ram It was a very
Interesting sight and I was so annoyed when the native policeman whit spends his day over here
to see that no one steals our tuckers strolled up and ordered them away from the gutted precincts
of the databya
Band Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings and I went for a long walk .
My Monday attempt proved that my leg is still too lume for riding Away to the north , standing in

are three palm trees They look exactly like the funny pictures of the African desert with an artist
up in one of them while a tion lashes his fail in front of a deserted case below . Cousin Emma says
the has hated those palm trees for years , and even I have got deadly tired of thein this winter . So
I walked to theal to see if I liked them better at close range . The first part of the walk led airing
the sands by the river's edge where the natives are planning their
links with short bunches of dry cane in them to keep the sand together show where melons
love abeady been planted , and little oblong bunches about the size of a large watermelon , show
where others are to be planted There ought to be an enormous crop in this isonediate vicinily
alone . Then I struck inland past a native village which has always looked so charming in the
ridge broken by shadufs and
distance and which was very squalld really does litle while broken by shades and i the
complaining satch around which a cow toiled I like
Camels always look so absolutely superior to anything they may be doing . I heard such a nice
reason the other day for the superciliousness of the camel . Allah Las one hundred names - the
Fruitful know ninety nine of them but the caine baum's the hundredth . Then I cut across a
cultivated linde guilty climbed up the other side and behold the three
freon , looking quite
love and presiding over the very verdant outskirts of a tiny village I
came back another way
and was ready for quarts of tea when I got here
