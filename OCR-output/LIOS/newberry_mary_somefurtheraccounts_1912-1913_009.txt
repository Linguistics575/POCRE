hen the felucca took Doris and me across the river, and Harry Burton
et us at the steps (he is sopping at the Winter Palace, there being no

00m for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church which

5 away at the rear of a garden filled with palms and acacias and other
Ovely things, and where an Arab was ringing the bell outside, us they did
n "Bunty". And Emily joined us inside. It Was very comforting to me

-0 have her to go to church with us this far land on this Day of Days.

(hen we came back to the Beduin we brought Harry and Mr. Crane (n young
son of the better knOWn Walter Crane) to luncheon.

.fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymkana in the Winter Palace
:ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for tea so we couldn't. The
‘ucks came and Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were

:razy about the boat, and we had a lovely time. They go on their way to
iairo tomorrow at one. We had such a perfectly enormous

inner tonight with only the four of us to eat it that by the time the
:urkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, and have it carried
.ff unscathed, for we had to eat plum pudding. Jones having heard me
‘emark that I was going to break over my total abstinence on Christmas in
>rder to drink a toast to you, had supplied champagne from the Wine
:ellar, wherever that may be.c The Cousins never touch champagne, so
Joris and I drank alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank a

:omprehensive toast to "all the people I love".

nglish artist,

 

’e had a splendid mail awaiting us when we got back from church this
norning. It Was so good to have it come on Christmas Day. I do hope

rou got my first letter very soon after you sent yours. I think I ex—
alained in it that people told us on no account to post letters at Gib.
)ecause it sometimes took months for them to reach their destinations from
there. So I only mailed you a postcard from there & sent my first letter

?rom Naples the minute we landed on the 27th.

Dec. 26th. Doris and I mounted on our gallant donkeys, (mine is named
Sugar) and followed by our donkey boys (mine is named Mahmoud) rode off
this morning towards the Libyan mountains, the object of our visit being
the Colossi — see picture enclosed, Which stand not far from their foot.
Fhe figures are SZfeet in height; the slab pedestals on which their
thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, making the entire height 65 ft.
Even in this land of mighty marvels they seem all that there is of the
extraordinary. Well, dearest, dozens of other letters must be

written, soiare thee well for DOW-

Endless love and many blessings on your belove head.
Your very own

Happy New Year, Best Beloved. I got up early so as to make my
greeting to you the first one I either uttered or wrote. And I wrote it
just in time, for in another two minutes Amelie came in with my orange

juice,- which is my waking ceremony every morning.

The principal thing that has Occurred since my last week's letter to
y0u was our visit to the Valley. We all went out last Friday, Doris,
Cousin T. and Jones riding, and Cousin E and I driving. It's seven

miles. I meant to ride also, but I found Cousin Emma hated to drive
