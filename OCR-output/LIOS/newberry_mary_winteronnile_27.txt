My own doings today have been of the humblest compared with the brilliant career of my
daughter. I spent the whole morning straightening out Cousin Theodore’s bank account, and
when I had ﬁnished my temperature was 120. After luncheon, to clear my brain and get some
much needed exercise, I went forth on a long walk with a sailor at my heels. I saw lovely things -
stretches of sloping river bank clothed in bean plants blossoming forth in stylish black and white
ﬂowers, great ﬁelds of peas with their reddish violet blooms, some brown little boys entirely nude
who dived frantically for their shabby garments when they saw me coming. Then home packed
with ﬂeas which I had annexed in a native village through which my walk led me.

On the deck of the Beduin in the lovely aﬁemoon light, I found the Contessa Contardone and Mr.
Tremaine taking tea with Cousin Emma. Another guest arrived on a donkey, Dr. Alan Gardiner,
an Englishman eminent for something but I don't know what. All I know is that he's much too fat.

And then our ears were smitten with an appalling though distant bray and we knew our family
was approaching. They looked like pictures of explorers returning from the heart of Aﬁ’ica as
they came in single ﬁle across the sand the baggage donkey at the head. Doris was beaming,
Maspero had pronounced the sarcophagus superlatively ﬁne - saying there was only one other like
it. He was unwilling to have the lid (lying face downward on the ground beside it) turned over
without the utmost care and is sending to Cairo for the proper apparatus. He wants the
sarcophagus for the Cairo Museum, M he wants Cousin T. to pay for its transportation thither
(he says it will cost 250 pounds sterling to do it) and Cousin T. does not at the moment feel
inclined to do it. Maspero and Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, lunched at
the House in the Valley with Cousin T., Doris and Harry Burton, and Doris says it was the treat
of a lifetime to hear Maspero talk, which he did from one o'clock till three-thirty. He talked about
Egypt and excavations, about Louis Quatorze brocades, about Chinese porcelains, about music,
about the way the Cretan women dress their hair, about Sevres enamel, about most of the

beautiful and interesting things in the world. Isn't it simply splendid that Don's could have had
such an experience?

Tuesday, Januagg 21. This m been a day! Some of the narrative of its events may tax your
credulity but I shall tell things simply as I saw them. The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on
a picnic to Medinet Habu, and we agreed to meet her out there at eleven o'clock. We started
gaily forth at ten with Nobi, Malimond and one of our sailors as escort. Doris has changed the
name of her donkey (which some idiot had christened "Lovely—Sweet") to Hermes, because he
goes so fast. My new mount, Wadi Halfa, the nefarious Sugar's successor, is a jewel, and I now
see delectable ambles spreading out on an almost endless vista before me. We had gone only a
short distance when Doris had a nasty spill. Her donkey stepped in a pitfall (forgetting that he
was supposed to have wings to his heels), threw her, fell on her and kicked her - not viciously but
in his struggles to get up. She declared she was not hurt and insisted on proceeding to the picnic.
(A lame shoulder for two days was the only bad result). Promptness being one of our petty
vices, we were of course the ﬁrst at the rendezvous. The Contessa and the rest of the picnic did
not arrive till quarter of twelve. But who would mind waiting indeﬁnitely at Medinet Habu on a
glorious day? The Contessa brought with her to entertain her guests the Snake Charmer of
Esneh, whom she had summoned down for the purpose. We started out at once skirting the
Coptic ruins which lie close to the southwest walls of the temple. Walking with leisurely steps in
advance of us went the stately ﬁgure of the Arab in his black robe and white turban, with the
ordinary long stick of the camel driver in his hand. Behind him stalked the Contessa all in white
from her snowy, ﬂoating veil to her spotless shoes (which didn't stay spotless), smoking one
cigarette after another. The rest of us, ten in number, came on by twos and threes, looking
perfectly commonplace in our ordinary donkey clothes. Over the burning sands we went under
the burning sun, while the Arab in a loud clear voice recited a sort of incantation. And from the
