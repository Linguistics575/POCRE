I think, in a way, that is the most amazing sight I've seen in Egypt. Those enormous subterranean
passages, those incredible titanic sarcophagi of granite, the inconceivable labor and ingenuity of it
all, in order that the sacred bulls should be ﬁttingly buried! Certainly they were an extraordinary
people, those ancients of Egypt. We ﬁnished our sightseeing with the tomb of Thir, where I got
so tired that I began to think of the back of my camel as a haven of rest. Then we mounted, had
our photographs taken, and turned our faces homeward. It took us just two hours to return and
when we got to Mena House at six we drank quarts of tea. We asked the waiter when the next
train would leave for Cairo and he replied "The next train has gone!" So we telephoned for a
motor and got back just in time to dress for our eight o'clock dinner. The wonders of Sakkara are
very great, but in my memory the chief glory of today will always be that enchanting ride over the
desert under that vast, vast sky of triumphant blue with heaped up masses of snowy cloud, the
sweet, wild wind in our faces and the effects of light and of driﬁing cloud - shadow things of
indescribable beauty.

Tuesday, April 1. Cousin Theodore had such a dreadful tooth this morning that I took him to the
dentist's and had it out. He suffered so horribly a year ago because he didn't have a tooth out, that
we didn't delay it on this occasion for fear he would change his mind. The news of Mr. J. P.
Morgan's death came this morning.

Cairo is bursting into bloom as beﬁts the time of year. The ﬂowering trees are something ecstatic.
We have one in the gardens of this place that is a dream of beauty. I think it's a kind of magnolia
- a very large tree with small blossoms.

This aﬁemoon Cousin Emma and I left cards on Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay, and on Mrs. Grahame,-
an Englishwoman whose husband is one 'of the ofﬁcials here, and then I came back to the hotel for
the great pleasure of having Emily and Marian Whitney to tea. It was so nice to see them. We
had tea in the great hall which was once the scene of an atrocious crime. This palace was the one
Ismail built for the Empress Eugenie to occupy at the opening of the Suez Canal. Aﬁer that he
had it for one of his own royal abodes. He had a foster brother who was supposed to be his
closest friend and his dearest one. He took him to drive one day and, on their return, as they
entered the great hall, guards seized the foster brother and killed him there while that unspeakable
beast, Ismail, strolled up the marble staircase as though nothing were happening. After tea, Mr.
Hine, the manager, took us through the Casino. It is so unattractive on the outside that I had
never taken the trouble to go in, little imagining the splendors of the interior. But it seems it was
a part of the royal harem and many of the old fumishings are still there, and it is really regal.

After we'd seen that I got a carriage and took the Whitneys to the Beduin as they never had seen
the inside of a dahabya. They graciously said they found it even more interesting than a royal
palace. They wanted me to go back with them to dine at their hotel, but I couldn't.

Wednesday, April 2.

The birds in the gardens about this place are legion. At night you can hear the mewing owls and a
lovely call in a chord of two notes that I'm told is made by a chamiing little plover that ﬂies in
pairs after dark. Early in the morning all kinds of birds begin shouting madly, and when we are
dressing sometimes a dashing black or gray crow sits on the railing of our balcony cawing forcibly
at us and waiting for us to leave the room so that he may ﬂy in and carry'oif things from the
dressing table. And today when Doris and I passed through the salon of this suite, two sparrows
were sitting facing each other in two gilt framed, yellow brocaded chairs. They ﬂy in and out as
they list. We all ﬁve of us motored about in a more or less aimless fashion this morning. And
once the Khedive ﬂashed by us like a ﬂame in his car. This aﬁemoon Cousin Theodore, Harry
