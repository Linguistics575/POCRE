'heart, blue robes with gay bandanas tied about the waist and white turbans. All except the two
captains, who wear black robes and no sashes. And also except Haneen the butler, whose raiment
is much more important. He, I believe, is a Capt. and wears a fez instead of a turban. The second
captain is a wholly ferocious looking individual. He looks as though he'd like to cut all our
throats for the simple pleasure of doing it. But he's been on the Beduin for years and is a great
friend of Jones, so I suppose he won't. There was a rose and orange and gold and turquoise and
violet and dove grey and sea green sunset tonight and the slenderest thread of a new moon anyone
ever saw. We hope to get off tomorrow. We are merely waiting for the tug which is to tow us.

Wednesday, December 11.

No tug appeared today; instead there came a young man from the ﬁrm of whom the tug is
engaged, a gay and smiling youth named Schwartz, who announced that a telegram had come
saying the tug was coaling at some place up the river and would anive early in the morning. "A
day late," I said. The Elders were napping so Doris and I were conducting the interview. "A day
late", he said with a gay shrug, "but what is a day?". " Nothing in Egypt" I had to admit, and truly
it has been so interesting watching the lazy life of the river that I don't care at all whether we go
or stay. Mr. Schwartz plied us with questions, winding up with "This is a government boat?"
"No, it is Mr. Davis' own. He had it built.“ "And you are going up the river alone?" "There are
four of us." "But how dull! Me, I should want sixteen in the party!" Think of having to be polite
for ten or eleven days in the narrow conﬁnes of a dahabya, to sixteen people! Doris and I would
not in the least object to one man - the vastly amusing Harry Burton - but he went to Luxor by
train last night, there being no room for him on the Beduin.

Thursday, December 12. The tug came before we were up this morning, but we had to

wait till the bridge opened at ten. It was very entertaining to see people trying to get across
before the bridge should become useless, as such, for an hour and a half. Doris and I fell into an
unseemly ﬁt of giggling over a ﬁmeral, all on foot, "beating" it over the bridge as though they
were going to a ﬁre. When the draw swung we slipped through, followed by another dahabya
ﬂying the Stars and Stripes. We have no idea whose she is - we only know we sailed away from
her early in the day and have had no glimpse of her since.

It has been a vivid Egyptian day with all that that means of light and color. And what scenes!
How can I even try to give the faintest idea of their strangeness, their charm, their savage or
seductive beauty? And the River itself -' small wonder that people have worshipped it for
centuries. It has a human personality which I feel. For long aﬁer leaving Cairo we passed towns
or scattered habitations more or less Cairo—like in their look and construction - cream colored
walls and an air of civilization. Those came to an end and then there were long stretches of
country, scattered native villages made of mud, with a beauty all their own, towering palms here
and there — large’ groves of them sometimes - then the grain ﬁelds with. a hum of industry about
them and great barges being loaded or unloaded - and always behind them on the East Shore the
Arabian desert with its line of hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, ﬁerce, desolate, burning,
superbly beautiﬁil beneath the magic of the Egyptian sun, but intolerable to even imagine under a
gloomy sky. At sunset we tied up to the bank between two tiny native hamlets. To eﬁ‘ect the
tying up process one of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder (this is a true
statement) and worries it into the sand; two of the crew go ashore each with an enormous
wooden pin the size of a country hitching post; two more of the crew, armed with gigantic
wooden mallets, hammer these pins into the sand and to these we are tied. Then a desert stillness
settles down upon us, while the stars blaze out overhead.
