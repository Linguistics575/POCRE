What is caﬂed the West Valley, which, though it contains tWO or three,

tombs, is not the valley of the Tombs, being divided from that by a
ridge. The house is long, low (one storied) flat—roofed, made of FOUg
stone, plastered with mud, and looking like thousands of Mexican hOUse

It stands in a narrow part of the valley with cliffs directly behind i Dal

is a delightfully orderly person. You know he is managing your uncleg 51
excavations and so lives out there in the house. All the water used g St

visit that place for the first time. A number of tombs are open to t“ 5
public, so George Bourne Will have no difficulty in gratifying his de t
But Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the valley,»
it was amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gaping tourists and disapp
into an opening labelled "No Admittance" from which were issuing cloud
of dust and a procession of children carrying dirt and rocks in basket
Which they emptied on a dump. Most of the manual labor in excavations
in this region is done by children and I hate it. They are urged on
overseers with whips. But our overseer was deprived of his whip last
year when Harry saw him cut a piece out of a boy's leg with the lash.

'Time fails to tell you of the marvels of the tombs we.saW.That after— q
noon I took a walk alone and climbed a ridge and went down into anotb
valley and up on the ridge beyond. And the sun went down, and withom n
sunshine it is the most terrible place I ever saw. The silence was b 5
ful, and I was suddenly siezed with a horror of the desert and fled b -}
to the house Where I was much rebuked for wandering off by myself. (
Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our tooties explor <
the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why all the kings didn" ‘
make their tombs there I cannot understand. It is the most regal,
stunning and awe inspiring place I think I ever saw.

Cousin Emma and I came home to the Dahabya Monday morning and glad
enough we were to get here. But Cousin Theodore and Doris-tarried ti
yesterday. He perfectly (excuse me!) adores it. But it would get on
nerves terribly unless I had all my occupations and Were really livim
there.
