The felucca had, according to orders, moved up stream till directly opposite the dahabya, and
therefore was lying in front of the tiny native village at which we gaze daily from the Beduin.
While sitting there I had ample opportunity to observe native life, some of which - like Sugar's
behavior - would sully these fair pages if chronicled thereon. The most pleasing episode was the
gambols of the children with two fuzzy black puppies whose sombre fate it is to grow up into
abhorrent, snarling, unloving and unloved Egyptian dogs. Three men in black robes and white
fringed shawls wound around their heads strode down the bank from the hamlet with a small flock
of sheep, which they picked up one by one and deposited in a boat. The animals neither struggled
nor uttered a bleat. Presently in a sort of hurly burly of dust, barking dogs and shouting children,
Cousin T. and Doris, with their escort of donkey boys and sailors, came down the bank, and we
rowed home to the Beduin. We found Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson teaing with
Cousin Emma. Dorothy Richardson is the daughter of Dr. Richardson of Athens and an
uncommonly attractive young woman. Her uncle, Mr. Hardy, is an ex-diplomat of sorts, whom I
suppose I ought to be able to place but can't.

Wednesday, January 15. I crossed over at ten o'clock to play tennis with Dorothy R. on the
Winter Palace court. We had two good sets before the sun grew too fervent, and then I leﬁ her to
her letters and started home for mine. Wednesday is our best mail day. En route to the felucca I
paused at the chemists and whom should I encounter there, buying a toothbrush, but Mrs. Fred
Morley, who for two or three years was my next door neighbor (and a very nice one) in Colorado
Springs! This afternoon Doris invited Dorothy Richardson to ride to Kamak with her, and they
were gone a long time and, Doris said, enjoyed themselves vastly. At tea time we had a visit from
Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero who came down the river in the Dahabya Miriam two days ago and
are to be here a couple of weeks. On Monday he is going over to the valley to give The Last
Word as to the importance of the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah. We are divided
between our hopes that it will be so ﬁne that Maspero will want it in the Cairo Museum, and that
it will fail by a hair's breadth to meet that requirement so that we can give it to the Metropolitan.

I forgot to record that Doris and I were again invited to dinner and the dance last night at the
Winter Palace. I declined, but Don's went and had a lovely time and met a lot of English ofﬁcers

Thursday, Januag 16. Nothing of any particular interest to record today - just a lovely day,
beginning pleasantly with waﬁles and maple syrup, and proceeding with a little too much wind
and therefore sand in the atmosphere. We all stayed by the Beduin this morning but in the
aﬁernoon Doris and I took the felucca and went over to call on Mrs. Morley. She and her son
Fritz are on the Egypt, one of Cook's new Nile steamers, and are here for a couple of days on
their way up the river. We took them over to the Winter palace to show them those lovely
gardens which have grown truly as if by magic in just four years. Incidentally we saw the little
Egyptian gazelle buck looking so dainty and charming it was hard to believe he had recently killed
four of his own children. We had tea on the terrace before separating, the Morleys to return to
the, Egypt and we to the Beduin.

If you could but see the stars from the vantage point of the Nile! Is there any other land I wonder
where Sirius glitters with such a blue diamond light?

Friday, January 17. A lovely morning and a disappointing aﬁemoon. Shortly after ten Doris and
I crossed over the river and went to see Mr. Whymper's pictures. We attracted the attention of
that gentleman by the simple process of whistling outside his window, his room being on the
ground ﬂoor of the Winter Palace. I did the whistling during and in spite of the protests of my
daughter, who seemed to think it a very vulgar proceeding. It has the advantage of giving the

West Bank, Luxor

Dearest Adeline;- Cousin Theodore and Doris are just back from the valley, having, like the
unreliable persons they are, stayed two days and nights when they said they would only be away
one. Doris is wild about the sarcophagus, and they both went into the tomb and saw it, though
Cousin Emma and I had given them cast iron orders not to, fearing it would cave in on them and
we miles away. The sarcophagus is of red granite, is 10 ﬂ. 3 in. long, 5ft. 3 in. wide, and 4 ft. 8
in. deep. It is covered with inscriptions and bears the cartouches of Siphtah. It is apparently in a
perfect state of preservation. The lid, which is lying beside it, face downward is 1 ft. 10 in. thick,
and evidently has a recumbent ﬁgure carved upon it. By lying on her tummy Doris managed to
see the two great feathers, part of a wig and one ear. Everyone of us is now agonizing for fear
the nose is broken. The sarcophagus is ﬁlled with debris and we don‘t yet know whether it
contains anything of value. A lot of broken alabaster objects have been unearthed in one comer
of the chamber, and Doris is the ostentatious owner of a small alabaster head with a lovely face
which she saw dug out. Isn't it gorgeous that we are here with things like that happening?

I was so anxious to hear their tidings (as well as needing exercise) that I started out on foot this
aﬁemoon hoping to meet them. Once in a while I do like to take a walk by myself, so I tried to
slip off without being seen. But the eagle eye of the ferocious second captain detected me, and in
three minutes I was being escorted by Sala, of the crew, with his heavy stick in his hand. We
ploughed through the sand till we reached the little path running through cultivated stretches, then
at right angles along the broader path which answers for a highway and is ankle deep in dust, and
where I had to sidestep donkeys laden with sugarcane and camels with mounted police; this for a
long distance till I came to a tiny mud village with an encircling wall, from the top of which a
yellow dog desired greatly to hurl himself on top of my hat, then under some ﬁne lebbek trees,
across a bridge an up on the embankment overlooking the vast plain where the Colossi sit forever
in state. There were hordes of people donkeying along (tourists mostly) but my party were
nowhere in sight so I turned around and came back again. I think white women never walk here,
except along the waterfront at Luxor, and if I'd been "a eﬁlant" or a rhinoceros I could hardly
have attracted more attention. It has been a grey day and I've resented it most unreasonably. One
really ought to be able to bear one grey day out of forty sunshiny ones, particularly when reading

the newspaper accounts of the frightful weather at home. I am so sorry and so concerned for you
all.

The Fahnstocks of New York and Newport have tied up in their Dahabya Cheops just to the rear
of us and their washing and ours have been ﬂapping on the sands in sweet accord all day.

Tuesday, January 14. Harry Burton came over from the valley early (Tuesday is his holiday) and
he and Doris and I crossed over to Luxor, they to wander among the beauties of Luxor and I to ‘
be prosaically shampooed. The morning was so gorgeous I hated to spend it that way. Harry
lunched with us on the Beduin and when he had, later, turned his donkey's nose toward the valley
and Cousin Theodore had arisen from his nap, the latter gentleman,

Doris and I rowed over to the Luxor landing, mounted our donkeys and started up the river - a
ride new to me, though the others had taken it once before. But we had barely started when
Sugar's conduct became unﬁt for print. He nearly threw me down an embankment, he brayed in a
manner that out-Juliused Julius, and I simply got off and refused ever to ride him again. The
others rode on and I descended the bank and sat in the felucca until they returned.

21into the immaculate felucca, and skimmed down the starlit river, with six white turbans bowing
rythmically before us as the men bent to their oars. Two of them, carrying lanterns, escorted us
from the landing to the hotel entrance and we found them standing like statues awaiting us when
we re-emerged in the middle of the night. We had a lovely time. Doris was much entertained by
amusing young Englishmen, some of whom danced well, and I enjoyed myself enormously talking
to some people and watching others. The Contessa was there looking as ghastly as a clown at a
circus. "They say" that last year she had yellow hair and a red face. This year she is in mourning
for her divorced husband (who was, very properly, shot a short time ago) so now her hair is black
and her face whitewashed. A young Englishman, who evidently hates her, told Doris that she was
the deplorable kind of elderly female who loves to have a phalanx of boys about her. As I'm that
kind myself I'm beginning to think I may like her when I really know her. She has invited me to
ride with her some time.

This afternoon Doris and I rode to our beloved Kamak. All Luxor watched our start and small
wonder, for there were nine men - six of the crew, two donkey boys and Jones trying to saddle
Sugar to suit me. This sounds as though I were getting ﬁissy but I'm not. It's only that Sugar has
such a small tummy that it seems impossible to cinch a side saddle to him securely, and it's misery
to ride on a turned saddle. Later Cousin Emma and I teaed on the Aziz with the Von Bissings,
whose table fairly tottered under the weight of things to eat.

Thursday, J anuam 9. A perfectly delicious day - it really has seemed to me the best air we've had
yet. Doris and I had a heavenly time this morning. We rode out to the Ramesseum starting early
and taking only Nobi and Malimond with us. It was lovely there - in a way I liked it better than
any of the ruins we've seen - there were no tourists, no excavating going on - just silence and
remoteness and sunshine and the mighty 'past. Mr. Nicoll came over this afternoon late to say
goodbye. He starts back to England tomorrow. We hear Lord Kitchener was in Luxor this
aftemoon. So near and I didn't see him! I have said — and believed I meant it - that there wasn't a
man in the world who could make me marry him, but if Lord Kitchener proposes to me I shall
undoubtedly accept him.

Friday, Januag 10. An exciting note from Harry this morning before breakfast saying that he has
unearthed a red granite sarcophagus, that the lid has fallen off, top downward, but evidently has a
recumbent ﬁgure carved upon it, and that it will take him about two days to remove the debris in
which it is embedded. Cousin Theodore has lost all interest in the tomb of Siphtah, for some
incomprehensible reason, and when he came in to breakfast and I said "Isn‘t it thrilling about the
sarcophagus?" he merely said "Ha!" But later he announced that he thought he'd ride over to the
valley tomorrow and take Doris with him - adding that he didn't think that the discovery of the
sarcophagus would prove to be of the least importance. Doris went to ride by herself this
afternoon, with a nautical escort, on the other side of the river and I took a walk with Cousin
Theodore on the sands. In one place where there were some damp hollows about 40 or 50
wagtails were apparently playing a game. It was charming to watch. They would jump into the
air and land lightly again with a little ﬂutter of wings, run a few steps and then jump into the air.
It was actually a gray aﬁernoon with a heavy and depressing atmosphere. The Von Bissings
lunched with us. The Baron's descriptions of things are unique. He was telling about a tree he
had seen in the morning that was "entirely ill and losing all its sings"! The Baroness says their
little girl (at home in Munich) always prefers to speak English "because" the child says "to speak
German makes me so hot! " I think that's a perfect description of the effect on one of a difﬁcult
tongue.

Goodbye for this time, my dears all

Your devoted Mary

20nature. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I took a long ride through larger tracts of cultivated

land than we had previously seen. Steam ploughs were at work and the irrigating ditches were
cemented and it all looked very modern and progressive and much less interesting and
picturesque.

Monday, January 6. This has been a lovely day (of course) but not an eventﬁil one. Doris and I
went over to Luxor in the morning and I had electricity applied - with comforting results - to my
neuralgic scalp. Then I sat for a little while on the sunny rear terrace of the Winter Palace and
talked to Mr. and Mrs. Davenport of Lincoln, Mass, while Doris was talking to some English
people on the front terrace. I stayed at home in the aﬁemoon and tried to prolong the life of my
stockings, until I had to cram them all into my mending bag on the advent of Baron and Baroness
von Bissing and Dr. Hermann Kees for tea. They came along the sands from their dahabya Aziz,
which is lying below us on the same side of the river. The Baroness is quite charming and speaks
English beautifully. The Baron is a sort of German translation of Leonard Bacon. He pounces
on your hand and kisses it, is never still a minute, talks excitedly and amusingly, is immensely
clever, gulps down cup after cup of tea and bolts his food with the rapidity of chain lightning. Dr.
Kees may be and probably is possessed of vast learning, but he is afraid to speak English which he
evidently understands, and his appearance is all that there is of callowness - he looks as though
"de eggshell not yet of is back".

Wednesday, J anuaﬂ 8. Yesterday was a day too crowded for any epistolary eﬁ‘orts on my part.
It began immediately aﬁer breakfast with a call from a sailing dahabya which, from lack of wind,
had paused just above us. Its occupants, a Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence and a Mr. and Mrs. Pope,
were crazy to meet Cousin Theodore, so they called. We liked them. They were very "plain
Americans" from Ohio, and took liberties with our mother tongue, but they were awﬁJlly nice.
Mr. Pope explained to me apologetically that he knew nothing whatever about Egyptian things as
he "never had been a historian". When they had departed we, all four, went across the river in the
felucca, the others stopping at Mr. Nicolls' dahabya to see his lovely pictures, and I going on to
Luxor for a ﬁtting of a blouse which is being made for me by a person who advertises herself as
"Ancient dressmaker to the Queen of Holland".

Harry Burton came over from the valley and lunched with us and in the aﬁemoon we all
proceeded to Medinet Habu to gaze upon the site where Cousin T. means to dig next. The others
rode, but Cousin Emma and I drove in a sand cart, a low hung, one—seated, two-wheeled cart, the
tires of the wheels being as broad as those of a motor car. A white mule was our steed, I held the
reins, and the driver and one of our sailors careered along beside us. I thought it was fun. Cousin
Emma thought it was awﬁJl, and vowed that never again would she get into that kind of vehicle.

It is the Coptic ruins adjoining Medinet Habu that we mean to excavate, and while we were
wandering about the appalling masses of debris a strong wind sprang up, and we got a taste of
what a sandstorm can be like. We made a frantic dash for home, and through a misunderstanding
Doris got left behind, and when I discovered it I had ﬁve thousand ﬁts. When we reached the
dahabya Jones' stern inquiry "Where is Miss Doris?" was the ﬁnal straw. I'm afraid my voice rose
almost to a shriek as I said "Nobi wouldn't dare not to take care of her!" (Nobi is her donkey
boy.) A sailor was instantly dispatched on a steed and Doris says he nearly rent Nobi limb from
limb when he ﬁnally met them, and it was in no way poor Nobi's fault.

Baths and evening clothes restored our poise, and Doris and I made our ﬁrst plunge into Luxor
society. Mr. and Mrs. Garret Pier, fascinating Americans stopping at the Winter Palace, had
invited us to dine and stay for a dance. And what an entrancing way to go to dimer! We stepped

l9Tuesday morning Cousin Emma and I went across in the felucca and paid Mr. Whymper a visit at
the Winter Palace and saw his last picture - a thing of beauty - birds on a sand bar, with all the
melted opal tints that we so oﬁen saw in the atmosphere as we came up the river from Cairo. He
also showed us a splendid study of a vulture, looking almost as noble as an eagle as he clasped a
lonely crag. "Close to the sun in lonely lands," I quoted, and Mr. Whymper, who is a very sudden
and enthusiastic person, almost clasped me = "l_\I_o! you don't know tlyit! How wonderﬁil! Dear
old Tennyson!" he shouted, and then together we bellowed the whole verse. From Whymper we
proceeded to call on the Contessa Contadone who, haply, was out. She came to tea yesterday
bringing a tired—looking young Englishman named Tremaine, whom she always has in tow, with
her. We found them here when we got back from Medinet Habu. What ruins those are - what
color and carving! Each place we go to seems more beautiﬁil and more incomprehensible than
the last. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I rode out to Der-el-Bahri. The start was
tumultuous and I almost gave up the expedition for the donkeys behaved so awfully. Even the
heretofore irreproachable Sugar was suddenly possessed of Satan. Doris vows that at one time all
three donkey boys and two of the crew were engaged in holding me on. It may be true.
Personally I never can remember details when a cyclone has struck me. But Der-el-Bahri with its
ruins of the mortuary temples of Queen Halshppsul and King Mentuhotep, with their entirely
different character from the other ruins we've seen, with their exquisite columns and Cloister
effects and the very beautiful view from their site high up on the base of the Libyan ranges, a view
over the desert, across the Nile and to Kamak beyond - all this was worth persevering for.

Saturday, January 4. This is coming to an abrupt close. I'm suffering tonight from an inexplicable
revulsion of feeling. I would rather - as I did - watch the row of kingﬁshers who practically live
on our cable and are too funny for words - than see the most beautiful temple in all Egypt. And I
would just as soon drop all my few jewels into the Nile as to read about Kamak or Luxor or the
Valley of the Tombs or anything in the world that's instructive. I'm very cross because I've got
neuralgia in my scalp - of all places - and I've torn my one and only decent hat to pieces and can't
get it together again, and you can't buy a hat this side of Cairo. So - well beloved fn'ends - I'll bid
you good-night - and in some happier frame of mind bid you good-morrow.

Your devoted
Mary

Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- It's been a beautiful day - and anything more trite than that observation in this
land could not be invented. Have I said anything about the climate? It's the one, for winter, that
I've dreamed of all my life. You can count, with almost absolute certainty upon waking up every
day to sunshine. You can cook to your heart's content by sitting in it, or be as cool as you like by
moving into the shade. The one thing you have to be careful about is to always have a coat or
wrap within reach.

Doris and I, accompanied by Amelie (who is French Protestant) went to church this morning,
am'ving in ample time to admire the bougainvillia spreading its splendid blossoms all over the
white facade of the little chapel. That is, 1 had time to admire it - Doris dislikes it because of its
color. But I maintain that magenta suits the tropics. We were also in ample time to have our
tympanums cracked by the bell which a native was jangling with primitive enthusiasm. The rector
looks awﬁilly ill and races through the service at that breakneck speed that is so trying to my slow

l8wreck of a world. On and on we drove through towering cliffs and amid a titanic chaos of broken
ﬂints and splintered rock and fossil shells, with not even the memory of a green growing thing for
miles upon miles. And then we came to a fork in the valley with a jutting ridge, a mighty one
between, and to the left goes the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings and to the right the West
Valley where Cousin Theodore's house is. It is a long, low and plastered structure with a ﬂat
roof, like thousands in Mexico. The dining room is at the front end and the sitting room at the far
end, and between the two runs a hall with four anchorites' cells for bedrooms opening off it.

Rough cement ﬂoors, rough plastered walls with little slits of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick
walls.

When we drew up in front of this residence slaves dashed out and kissed our hands and did our
boots with a feather duster. The rest of the party were hot on our heels. Julius Caesar (Cousin
Theodore's donkey - and a perfect devil) braying his head off. He so loves the sound of his own
voice that he brays all the time. Then we entered and took possession, Harry Burton doing the
honors. As Cousin Theodore's Manager of Excavations he lives in the House in the Valley. He'd
given up his room to me. "It may smell of disinfectant, but it's all right - it doesn't mean anything
except that the last chap died here, you know", he explained. A short time before we arrived they
had killed a ﬁve foot snake by the great water jars in the shed near the front door, and Doris
found a deceased mouse in her wash basin. So I felt rather squeamish when I entered my cell
after dark and wondered what I might possibly touch before I got the candles lighted; therefore
when the whole box of matches ﬂared off at once in my hand I most naturally shrieked. The
nights were wonderﬁil, the stars blazed so close you could almost pick them from the velvet sky,
the silence surpassed anything I've ever known - no faintest shadow of a sound except when a
sudden gust of wind swept past, and was utterly gone, like the moan of a wild beast. And all
night long a guard with a riﬂe stood at the front comer of the house to ward off any wandering

~‘sons of the desert who might drop into the valley by thejackal trails leading over the cliffs.

i

The next morning we had a sort of royal progress into the valley of the Tombs - Cousin Theodore
on the vociferating Julius, Cousin Emma in a carrying chair with two bearers, Doris and Jones and
I on foot. That morning was one of the sensations of Doris's and my lives, but I won't bore you
with descriptions, for is it not all written in the Books of Belzoni, Weigall, Budge, Dans, Petrie
and others? Aside from all the wonder and beauty and impressiveness that we saw there was the
ﬁm of sailing by groups of staring tourists into a place labeled largely "No Admittance" and
entering the tomb of Siphtah where Cousin T. is doing the only excavating at present going on in
the valley. It was very dusty and very dark except in ﬂashes where the light was thrown in by a
mirror at the mouth. And a procession of children were carrying out the debris in baskets. The
thing I hate in this country is the way they work the children. At Kamak overseers stand by with
long-lashed whips, but our overseer is not permitted a whip. That aﬁemoon I took a walk by
myself, climbing a ridge and going down into a third valley and up another ridge. The sun had set
and the silence was dreadful, and suddenly a horror of the desert (quite different from ordinary
fear) seized me and I ﬂed back to the house, where I was seriously taken to task for wandering
about by myself. Sunday aftemoon Cousin T., Don's and I made an expedition up our own west
valley, and anything more superb, austere and overpowering I think I've never seen. Two or three
of the Kings elected to be buried there, and I wonder all of them didn't; it's so much more
spectacular and imperial than the other valley.

Monday morning immediately after breakfast Cousin Emma and I departed, the others reluctantly
promising to follow the next day. And wasn't it good to get back to the Beduin and bath tubs and
clean clothes, and the haunting river with its palm trees and gardens on the Luxor side, and the
desert all the more beautiful for being retired to the background.
