Theodore quite refused to let D. and me go ashore even with the peer-

shortly, FThere's no knowing what they might say to you". "Not with
me there, sir," said Jones. But he wouldn't let us go. However the
flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in '
moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely packed buildings
