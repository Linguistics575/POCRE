over, to relax their minds their Highnesses began asking conundrums of each other in English.
The ﬁrst one was too improper for me to record. Then Prince Radziwill said “Why is Sir William
Frazer like a ﬂannel petticoat?" the answer to which was "Because he shrinks from washing."
When Doris' and Harry's heads went down on the table in gasps of laughter, Princess R. said in a
shocked tone "Oh! those people understood!" We have found out that the Japanese mask is a son
of the great Blucher.

We are in sight of Naples, and it's cold and raining like anything. But am I such a poor thing as to
grumble at a rainy day when I_'ve had four months of gorgeous sunshine?

52During the last week in Cairo there was a little social ﬂavoring mixed in with shopping,
sightseeing and the daily round. I lunched one day with the Contessa and Mr. Tremayne at the
Continental, and Mr. Tremayne, putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out a little wad of
paper, said- "Here, Mrs. Newberry, is an antique I've been carrying about for weeks meaning to
give you" and there was a heavenly bit of the perfect Egyptian blue with the sacred eye or Horus
on it - the very thing I had hunted for in vain in the shops at Luxor.

I've had it set in a ring and it's fascinating.

Various people came to call, among them Watson Pasha, a Personage indeed in Egypt, being the
Khedive's one English aide. I was out the aﬂemoon he came but I met him a day or two after at a
tea at the Grahames and found him a most delightful person. Lean and tanned and simple and
direct and amusing. S_o tanned that if it were not for the clear cut, clean English features he might
easily have been taken for a native. The King of Siam did take him for one. He had been sent to
meet that potentate and escort him through the Suez Canal. Major Watson was wearing the
uniform of the Egyptian Army and as His Majesty of Siam shook hands with him he said "I hope it
is perhaps that you speak a few words of English". As he told me this story he was taking his
amber cigarette holder from a gold case. "That is the most sumptuous thing I ever saw" I said.
"Wait!" said he and brought out a gold cigarette case and a gold matchbox. "Backshish" he

explained. "They can't give me money so they give me these things and I'd so much rather have a
check for a thousand'pounds! "

The Grahames' place is one of the sweetest I've ever seen, such lovely gardens, such beautiful
trees, - a fresh proof of the tmth of what I've always said that the English

have a genius for taking England with them wherever they go. We had tea on the verandah, and
black and grey crows were waiting closeby, until we should turn our backs, to steal the cakes.

Our last evening in Cairo was a dream of beauty with the slenderest thread of a new moon
ﬂoating above a towering auracaria in the garden. The Ghezireh people must have been glad to
have us go - they'd been keeping the hotel open just for us and closed it when we leﬁ. Mr.
Backler, the manager of Shepheard's and the Ghezireh, sent his own motorcar to help convey us
to the station as a parting compliment to Cousin Theodore. Various people were at the station to
see us oﬁ‘, including seven of the crew of the Beduin, all there were leﬁ in Cairo, the others
having scattered. They all shook all our hands three separate times and my friend Mohamed, the
second captain, looked perfectly superb. We leﬁ Cairo at 9:45 and for three hours and a quarter
our train sped through lovely scenes. We sailed at two that aftemoon and the inﬁnite boredom of
seafaring has soaked to the marrow of my bones. There are a lot of awfully good looking men on
board and if I knew some of them it might relieve my ennui - but the voyage is too short for
making acquaintances. There are three Les Altesses, one of whom has a face like a Japanese
mask and blows his nose so deafeningly and oft that I'm in constant fear that Cousin Theodore
will speak to him about it. But the Prince and Princess Radziwill (I can't spell it) look the part
quite satisfyingly. It has been a polar sea today instead of a summer one. I do so hope we shall
ﬁnd a little warmth in Italy. We expect to arrive in Naples at noon tomorrow.

Heaven bless you all, my dears.

- Devotedly, Mary

P.S. Saturday A.M. Last evening I represented the family at the Ship's Concert while Cousin
Theodore, Doris and Harry were playing cards in the smoking room. At a table near them sat the
Japanese Mask and the Radziwills talking to each other in six different languages. The Japanese
mask blew his nose and Cousin Theodore bounded in his chair, turned and glared at him and said
"Good Heavens!" in a loud voice. Then the Japanese mask began spouting pages of Virgil; that

51and I motored out to Mena House for tea, and on the way we saw a quite horrid sight. The
sidewalk in front of a handsome house was drenched with blood, and a dead buffalo was just
being dragged away by the heels. Neither Cousin Theodore nor Harry knew what it meant, but I
did, having just read about the custom in a book called "Veiled Women". It's one of their pleasing

little marriage ceremonies when a bride enters her new home to cut the throat of a live buﬁ‘alo in
front of her at gateway or door.

This must go in its unﬁnished condition. These are such crowded days, and such beautiful ones -
the air goes to my head like wine.

Much love to you all. My next will probably be posted at Naples.
Your devoted
Mary.

April 11.
S. S. Prince Heinrich

The Mediterranean

Dearest Adeline:— I‘m not sure about the number of this letter but it's next to the one I stopped
abruptly last week.

Our winter in Egypt is a thing of the past, but with spring in Italy and England before us, and
Home after that, we go on our way rejoicing in spite of certain regrets and the fact that camels
have dropped out of our lives "it may be for years and it may be forever". Chief among my
regrets are the following: ' '

I did not see Lord Kitchener

I did not see a polo game

I saw no dervishes.
While we were at Luxor there was some sort of a function that brought the dervishes to Cairo,
and they lay in the street while their sheik rode over them on horseback. We read about it in the
papers. Certainly some of the spectacles in Egypt are lurid ones, and I thank Heaven I belong to
the Anglo-Saxon race. Doris and Hany saw a sight the day we went to the Tombs of the Caliphs
which haply escaped me as we ﬂashed by in the motor car, and that was children prisoners in
chains. I should think Lord Kitchener would "advise" the Khedive to discontinue that practice.
However, I suppose it takes time for even a giant like Kitchener to correct all of the worst abuses
in a land so packed with them. That expedition to the Tombs of the Caliphs I hug to my memory
with special delight because we came near not seeing them and it would have been such a loss.
They make, on the outskirts of Cairo and close to the edge of the desert, a little city of their own
crowned with beautiful domes and exquisite minarets, and are so wrapped in sunshine and
loveliness that there is no thought of gloom. That same day we went to see a mosque whose
name no one could remember and the guide books were all packed. But it's the second largest
one in the world and is a beauty, with its hundreds of columns built around a large and arid court
in the center of which is a well and one tree. The two principal things that are pointed out to you
are the granite column and a magic stone. The granite column came to the mosque all by itself
from Mecca. And the stone is possessed of healing properties so that when the Faithﬁil have aches
in their tummies they go and lick the stone till their tongues bleed. They've licked a deep groove
in the stone and the whole thing looks quite horrid. Lord Kitchener must have"advised" the
stopping of that rite, because recently an iron grating has been put in front of the stone.

50I think, in a way, that is the most amazing sight I've seen in Egypt. Those enormous subterranean
passages, those incredible titanic sarcophagi of granite, the inconceivable labor and ingenuity of it
all, in order that the sacred bulls should be ﬁttingly buried! Certainly they were an extraordinary
people, those ancients of Egypt. We ﬁnished our sightseeing with the tomb of Thir, where I got
so tired that I began to think of the back of my camel as a haven of rest. Then we mounted, had
our photographs taken, and turned our faces homeward. It took us just two hours to return and
when we got to Mena House at six we drank quarts of tea. We asked the waiter when the next
train would leave for Cairo and he replied "The next train has gone!" So we telephoned for a
motor and got back just in time to dress for our eight o'clock dinner. The wonders of Sakkara are
very great, but in my memory the chief glory of today will always be that enchanting ride over the
desert under that vast, vast sky of triumphant blue with heaped up masses of snowy cloud, the
sweet, wild wind in our faces and the effects of light and of driﬁing cloud - shadow things of
indescribable beauty.

Tuesday, April 1. Cousin Theodore had such a dreadful tooth this morning that I took him to the
dentist's and had it out. He suffered so horribly a year ago because he didn't have a tooth out, that
we didn't delay it on this occasion for fear he would change his mind. The news of Mr. J. P.
Morgan's death came this morning.

Cairo is bursting into bloom as beﬁts the time of year. The ﬂowering trees are something ecstatic.
We have one in the gardens of this place that is a dream of beauty. I think it's a kind of magnolia
- a very large tree with small blossoms.

This aﬁemoon Cousin Emma and I left cards on Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay, and on Mrs. Grahame,-
an Englishwoman whose husband is one 'of the ofﬁcials here, and then I came back to the hotel for
the great pleasure of having Emily and Marian Whitney to tea. It was so nice to see them. We
had tea in the great hall which was once the scene of an atrocious crime. This palace was the one
Ismail built for the Empress Eugenie to occupy at the opening of the Suez Canal. Aﬁer that he
had it for one of his own royal abodes. He had a foster brother who was supposed to be his
closest friend and his dearest one. He took him to drive one day and, on their return, as they
entered the great hall, guards seized the foster brother and killed him there while that unspeakable
beast, Ismail, strolled up the marble staircase as though nothing were happening. After tea, Mr.
Hine, the manager, took us through the Casino. It is so unattractive on the outside that I had
never taken the trouble to go in, little imagining the splendors of the interior. But it seems it was
a part of the royal harem and many of the old fumishings are still there, and it is really regal.

After we'd seen that I got a carriage and took the Whitneys to the Beduin as they never had seen
the inside of a dahabya. They graciously said they found it even more interesting than a royal
palace. They wanted me to go back with them to dine at their hotel, but I couldn't.

Wednesday, April 2.

The birds in the gardens about this place are legion. At night you can hear the mewing owls and a
lovely call in a chord of two notes that I'm told is made by a chamiing little plover that ﬂies in
pairs after dark. Early in the morning all kinds of birds begin shouting madly, and when we are
dressing sometimes a dashing black or gray crow sits on the railing of our balcony cawing forcibly
at us and waiting for us to leave the room so that he may ﬂy in and carry'oif things from the
dressing table. And today when Doris and I passed through the salon of this suite, two sparrows
were sitting facing each other in two gilt framed, yellow brocaded chairs. They ﬂy in and out as
they list. We all ﬁve of us motored about in a more or less aimless fashion this morning. And
once the Khedive ﬂashed by us like a ﬂame in his car. This aﬁemoon Cousin Theodore, Harry

49mahogany colored horses with pinky-red harness and trappings. Native military bands, splendid
to look upon, but "Allah be obeyed! How infernally they played!" Soldiers and gun can‘iages and
an absolutely ineffectual band of native police who failed entirely to clear the streets for the
progress.

I'm ﬁnishing this Saturday evening. Doris and Harry are intolerably set up because the Grand
Duchess smiled at them not once but twice this aﬂernoon. We've all decided we like her very
much but not her august husband. He looks as though he could burn people at the stake and
enjoy doing it.
Goodnight, dears, and love always from
Your Mary

Sunday night, March 30.
Ghezireh Palace, Cairo

Dearest Adeline:- (As I hate paper that opens backwards, I'm writing on this wrong side before.)
It has been a heavenly day, such a relief from yesterday, which was what the knowing call
"Khamsing". That, brieﬂy described, means a dead, thick feeling in the air which has a most
deplorable effect on the nerves. I tried to make myself believe yesterday that I was homesick, but
I wasn't - I was merely in a villainous temper, wanting to bite everybody‘s head off and then have
a crocodile bite mine. But it rained a little in the evening and today has been fresh and delicious.
Harry and I went to church in the morning and the ﬁne looking soldier boy who was usher hid us
behind a pillar so that we saw nothing and the clangor from the street prevented us from hearing
anything - which proves one advantage of knowing your service by heart. Mr. Bonham Carter
joined us on the way out and we walked to the Hotel Angleterre to see if Miss Elena Rathbone
had arrived from India. She hadn't, so Harry and I hopped into a humble vehicle and drove home.
In the aﬁemoon he and Doris went to the Zoo in the hope of seeing Lord Kitchener, who is
supposed to haunt the place Sunday aﬁernoon. He skipped today but they had many other
delights, including baby lions, and a baby elephant which marched in front of a band of Scotiish
pipers. And they had tea on a tiny island surrounded on all sides by ﬂamingoes and pelicans and
came home in a joyous frame of mind. In the meantime we had had a charming call from Mr.
Anthony, an Englishman in the Department of Finance, who liked our tea so much that he drank
three cups.

Monday, March 31. Had I ever guessed the wild delight of riding a camel, never would I have
wasted a whole winter on the lowly and diminutive donkey. Today we went to Sakkara and back
- twenty miles in all - on camels, and though I'm very sore in spots tonight it was a blissful
experience. We had an early breakfast - Doris, Harry and I - and then motored out to Mena
House, where camels and luncheon had been ordered for us. Lady Hilda Keppel, a charming
Englishwoman we've met here, went with us, so we felt almost like a camel corps. The one thing
I had dreaded was the getting up of the beast, but I was spared the immediate terrors of
anticipation, because the instant I touched the saddle, before I had had time to arrange my legs or
anything, Mena heaved his mighty bulk into the air and I went up shrieking. Later on as we were
loping over the desert, the exhilaration of it went to my head and I shouted from my eminence to
Doris's "I never was so happy in my life." It took us two hours and a half to get there, and though
we were starving to death we heroically did two tombs and a pyramid before going to the rest
house and unpacking our lunch basket. We had no time for dawdling, so, luncheon over, we
started immediately for the Serapeum.

48mirrors - mirrors everywhere. Ismail's vanity must have been colossal if he liked to see himself at
every turn, because his portrait, hanging in the dining salon, is anything but seductive. Qur table
in said salon is directly next that of the Grand Duke Constantine and therr interest in us rs much
more open than we condescend to let ours in them appear. Tonight at dinner, though they had.
guests, the Grand Duke kept turning around and staring at us. They evrdently knew who Cousm
Theodore was. The Grand Duchess looks nice and simple and is very jolly in spite of her fresh
mourning for the King of Greece. But the Duke has a ﬁshy eye and a sinister cast of countenance.
I wouldn't care to know him but I'd like very much to meet the Duchess, which I have not done,
though the opening sentence of this letter might lead you to suppose that we toddled hand in hand
to the tailor's. We were much amused watching the people in the dining room tonight. Really
Englishwomen are, this year, even more eccentric than Americans in their coiﬂ‘ures. Mrs. Aylmer,
wife of Col. Aylmer, came to dinner in a peacock blue satin bathing cap with rhinestones all
around the edge. I wish I had the nerve to do that sort of thing and then I could stop agonizing
over my hair.

We truly have done little worth recording this week. It has been very warm - we've had errands
to do which have taken time, and when we've simply gone for a drive in the motorcar it has been
to no place in particular.

Saturday morning. I'm wondering if you can read this at all - it's written so horribly. I don't know
what's got into my penmanship.

Last Sunday being Easter, Doris and I took the precaution of going to church three-quarters of an
hour early, and a steady stream of people was entering then. We sat on the side aisle and on the
wall before us was a marble tablet Sacred to the Memory of the Riﬂemen of the 3rd Batallion of
the King's Royal Riﬂes, with its three divisions - Killed in Action, Died of Wounds, and - by far
the longest list - Died of Sickness. That seemed to me the most pathetic from its lack of glory,
though there may have been quite as much heroism in connection with it as in either of the other
two. The church was packed to bursting, and never have those beloved words "Christ is risen
from the dead and become the ﬁrst fruits of them that slept" thrilled me more than in this alien
land where the cross with its few thousands towers above the crescent and its millions.

Tuesday morning Harry came down from Luxor and that evening he took Doris and me to the
Torchlight Tattoo at the Kaar-el-nil parade ground. It was quite a splendid spectacle. I enclose
the programme and beg you of your courtesy to keep it for me. All the performances took place
in an immense hollow square, three sides of which were outlined by two hundred Gordon

Highlanders each holding a torch. I must confess that the "Grand Military Fantasia - The Battle
of Minden" was anything but impressive. I've seen inﬁnitely better sham ﬁghts in a Wild West
Show. But the rest of it was ﬁne. And "Abide with me" played with a continuous roll of drums

for an undertone was one of the most effective things I ever heard. I caught a glimpse of my
Russian Princess looking lovelier than ever.

Wednesday morning we all went to the Museum and I was enchanted to ﬁnd that it was as though

scales had fallen from my eyes. Things that had no meaning to me before we went up the river
were packed with it this time.

Thursday aﬁemoon Cousin Emma, Doris and Harry went to Shepheard's Hotel and from a
balcony witnessed the procession - the bridal procession of the Khedive's daughter. It was short
but magniﬁcent. Of course the bride was wholly invisible, being hermetically sealed in a superb
mahogany and gold coach with pinky-red velvet hangings, and drawn by six

47the grass is very green, there are a few charming ﬂowering shrubs, a palm tree or two, and the
steps cut in the bank to the road above have been greatly improved in quality and looks. The
gardener himself is a rather dressy looking person with an obsequious grin which I dislike. His
subordinate who does the sprinkling is quite unpleasant to look upon - a fat old patty dressed in
layers of what would seem to be dirty nightshirts, each one shorter than the one underneath it.

We found the ﬂags at half mast and could not learn what for until Jones came back ﬁ'om an
expedition into the town and said the poor King of Greece had been murdered.

We have - or are to have tomorrow - the same ﬁne, red motorcar we had before. This aﬁernoon
we had to use a substitute when Cousin Theodore, Doris and I motored out to Mena House for
tea. The pyramids looked much more impressive to me than the last time. By the way, the stories
of Reisner's marvelous ﬁnd in the Sphynx are mere newspaper inventions. Reisner has been
exploring in Dongola all winter -.excavating, I mean. It's very amusing to watch the people at
Mena House arriving from expeditions on donkey back and camel. When Harry comes down
from Luxor he and Doris have planned to go to Sakkara by camel. I am invited but an eight mile
ride on a camel when I'm not used to that mode of travel gives me pause. However, I may do it.
I'm going to Sakkara, of course somehow.

Good Friday, March 21. Doris wasn't feeling well this morning so I went to church alone,
conveyed thither in the bright red car. The chauffeur, a Levantine, I should think, had apparently
never heard of the English Church, All Saints, but pretended to understand his instructions, with
the result that we wandered aimlessly, though rapidly, about for some time. We got there at last
in time. It was a nice and simple service. The church was full - loads of men. On the way out I
paused at the end of the church to do homage to the small, plain marble tablet in memory of
General Gordon. Outside the door I found Mrs. Romeyn and Estelle waiting for me. I had hoped
to see them at church, but had looked in vain. I took them to their hotel, the Continental, and got
back to the boat just at luncheon time. This aﬁemoon Cousin Theodore, Don's and I motored out
into the desert, the beautiful, haunting desert, and then had tea at Heliopolis. Though we were
going rather slowly, for a motor car, we ﬂashed all too rapidly for Doris and me through the
streets with their fascinating, fascinating sights. Probably there are places in India where there is
the same medley of nationalitiesas here, but I never imagined anything like it. Our hearts warmed
to the sound of the pipes and the sight of a Highlander in kilts.

Good-bye, my dears.
Your most devoted Mary

March 28 1913.
Ghezireh Palace

 

Dearest Adeline:— The Grand Duchess Constantine and I have been having our clothes made at the
same place this week and it has leﬁ us little time for our writing. In fact, these past seven days
since my last letter have seemed a little too commonplace to be treated in the usual journal way,
so I'll give you merely a sort of resume. We moved from the dahabya this moming - it was
getting too hot to stay there - and ﬁnd ourselves in the vast spaces of this palace which once
belonged to Ismael. The size of everything is fairly oppressive. Doris and my bedroom is as big
as our whole apartment in Orange Street. The bathroom must be thirty feet high (the other rooms
of course the same, only it's more apparent in the bathroom) and nailed on the wall, by way of
decoration, is a fan whose sticks are a yard long. All through the Palace there are the most superb

46Tuesday, March 18.
Going down the Nile.

Dearest Adeline:- This trip down the Nile, to which we looked forward with such keen pleasure,
remembering the rapture of the one up, has been a great disappointment because of the incessant
and violent winds. Cousin Emma has scarcely been on deck at all. The rest of us have spent
much time there, but usually with a growing initation at being blown off the map, until the point
would be reached when one or all of us would leap out of our chairs with an exasperated "I'_m
going down - this is too much for me." I can't remember whether I ﬁnished my last letter
Saturday or Sunday. But anyway I did not tell you, did I, about the lovely walk I had just before
sunset and just after on Sunday evening? We tied up a little earlier than usual by a lovely bank,
and I started out immediately with Amelie and the usual sailors. We took to what Amelie (who
knows this country well) called the highroad. It was literally that, being on sort of an
embankment with deep ditches on either side. But it was little more than a footpath winding
indeﬁnitely through desert stretches, fascinating villages and cultivated ﬁelds, and palm trees

scattered almost everywhere. It was such a lovely thing to be doing Palm Sunday, and the whole
thing looked as I imagine Palestine.

Yesterday nothing particular occurred except our stopping at Minya for mail. Doris and I walked
to the post ofﬁce with Jones and sailors and then to the railroad station, thereby seeing the main
part of the town, which is a ﬂourishing one but not interesting. Today we spent four or ﬁve hours
a little below Shekh Fadl while the tug coaled. We were tied to a high and very dull bank, and in
four or ﬁve hours even the ducks can cease to amuse.

Wednesday, March 19. This E been a day. A hideous wind, as usual. Then early this morning
we sat on a sandbank for an hour in company with Cook's large steamers, a small steamer and
twenty-seven native boats. We were the ﬁrst to get off and sail away and I suppose they all hated
us. For the rest of the day we've played tag with the Arabia and the Rameses III (the two big
Cook steamers). They would pass us haughtily, then around a bend in the river we'd ﬁnd them
stuck again and we'd sail by. I don't know how many times that happened. And once when we
came upon them stranded and our tug went aground on the same bar for a few minutes, in its
frantic struggles to get free it rammed the Rameses, which must have annoyed that monarch
greatly. We are tied up tonight about thirty miles from Cairo and a new hat. I hunger and thirst
for a new hat. There are no words to express the fatigue that takes possession of me when I don
one of my two sun-burned, faded, pinned out, dilapidated head coverings. We are to continue
living on the boat for about a week before moving to the Gazireh Palace. It is with a pang that
we have today lost sight of the desert, on the edge of which for three months we have lived in a
highly civilized and luxurious way - minus, of course, two things that are supposed to go with
civilization now. We've not seen a motorcar since leaving Cairo and we couldn‘t have telephoned
anywhere to save our lives!

Thursday, March 20. - Cairo. We started a little before six this morning and were lucky enough
to make the bridge just before it closed aﬁer the moming opening. If we'd been ten minutes later
we would not have got through until aﬁemoon. The wind kept on with unabated zeal but we
found the entrance into the city's environs very interesting. I wonder if custom could stale for me
the interest, ever. Our tying up place looks perfectly charming - it's the beauty spot of the bank.
Not being here to superintend the planting ourselves, our gardener has got that mixture of
everything - purple and red and pink - that the Oriental loves, but the effect is gay and springlike,

45thoroughly enjoy belonging to the conquering and superior races. 1% to have silent, poor,

inoffensive people pushed off the public highway in order to give me three times more room than
I need.

Thursday, March 13. Nag Hamadi. It has been a perfectly hateﬁil day — with the wind blowing
everything and everybody off the face of the earth. We tied up here in the middle of the day

because it was too dangerous to go through the drawbn'dge in such a gale. It is a cold and
glittering mght. The Mayﬂower, presumably with Mr. Weston on board, is lying on the other side
of the river, waiting for the opening of the bridge in the morning.

Friday, March 14. The Nile near Giegole. This has been a great day - one of the best we've had
in Egypt. We reached Beliana about eleven I think, and as soon as we could after that we started
for Abydos - Doris and Haneen on donkeys, and Amelie and I in a brougham (of all things in the
world to drive about Egypt in) with a coronet on the door! Also there was a very gorgeous
native policeman on a proud Arabian barb prancing beside us. They say Beliana is a very bad
town - and somehow it looked it. The eight mile drive to Abydos is through such beautiﬁil
country. As you leave the town there seem to be great estates on either side with ﬁne palm
groves. Then come vast ﬁelds of grain, green and golden, and reaped and stacked and many
ﬂocks and herds, and the abodes of the tribes tending them are out in the broad ﬂat topped stacks
of grain! And there was so much joyous young life bounding and cavorting about the ﬁelds and
on the highway, baby donkeys, baby camels, baby calves and kids and lambs. The temple of Teli I
at Abydos is so surrounded by hills of rubbish that it has the effect of being a sunken one, and the
facade is so very ruinous that the splendors of the interior are all the more striking, - the most
beautiful carving, it seemed to us, that we've seen in Egypt. We found a Cook's party of about
twenty-ﬁve having luncheon in the temple, and being starving we promptly had ours, beginning
with a libation to the gods as Haneen dropped the water bottle just as we entered. It was
delightful wandering about the temple. So much of the roof is gone that much of the place basks
in sunlight. We did not go to the other temple - that of Rameses II - because it is a very inferior
one, and we didn't want to take too much time. As we were leaving, the onslaught of natives with
things to sell and natives who only wanted to beg and everybody yelling at once, and their
vanquishing by Amelie, reminded me of a verse in the Psalms "They came about me like ﬂies - and
were extinct even as ﬁre among thorns". Again we had the delights of the drive, marred only by a
tearing wind. Once our horse shied violently at a Beduin riding by on a camel in the deep ditch by
the high road. Our driver explained that the horse disliked the Beduin headdress. As we neared
gu_r Beduin on the road by the river we had to make our 'way through trains of camels laden with
bags' of onions which were being unloaded from ghiassas (I don't know how to spell them, but
they are the native boats with the Viking prows and enormous sails). We got back in ample time
to pull up stakes and make some headway before nightfall.

Saturday, March 15. Tied above Abutig. It's been another day spoiled by a tearing wind which
destroys all the pleasure of being on deck. Early this morning before we were up we passed
Cook's Steamer Amenartis on her way to Aswan, with Emily and Marian Whitney on board. I'm
so sorry to have missed them at Luxor. We have passed Akhenim, a very large and ﬂourishing
native town, to which, according to tradition, a heathen princess once came riding to desecrate a
temple, and the earth opened and swallowed her up. The most beautiful sight today was what
looked like the preparing of a caravan to go somewhere into the interior - camels were being
loaded with all kinds of strange things and the mingling of colors was quite ravishing. We are
getting into the land of colored raiment again instead of the black and white of upper Egypt.

Good-bye, dears, much love from

Your devoted Mary

44Shortly aﬁer luncheon Mr. Lancelot Crane appeared and stayed to tea. He and Harry and I_)oris
and I always have a lot of amusement talking together. Two ladies, acquaintances of Cousin
Emma's, just down from Wadi Haifa on the Mayﬂower, also came to tea. At intervals during the
day I watched the ﬁmny performances of the poultry, which amuse me so, and which form such a
queer link between this strange and ancient land and the everyday, humble things at home. I really
thought the devotion to Sir Francis Drake exhibited by his ladies was carried to excess when he
pulled a feather out of himself and one of them instantly swallowed it. The yellow dog was lying
contentedly on the sand while two turkeys walked round and round him relieving him of his ﬂeas!
And - to my great delight - I saw a wild goose, ﬂying with outstretched neck, between the river
and the range.

Wednesday, March 12. Dendereh. It's hard to say which was the more beautiﬁil - the dawn I saw
this moming at Luxor or the sunset from the top of the temple here. It was a hectic leaving. - ’
About eleven we got off, and for two hours before that the sands in our immediate vicinity were ’
dotted with natives come to say good-bye in the hope of a ﬁnal backshish. Mrs. Winlock and
Dorothy Richardson rode over from the American House to bid us farewell. Mohammed
Mohassib came in a steam launch and was both pathetic and impressive. He is a great personality.
He is planning to take his grandson and go to Mecca later on - for when we and his other foreign
friends are gone there will be "no nice people in Luxor, no nice people at all." He says that once
when he went to Mecca he took "threeteen" people with him. As we passed the Luxor waterfront
on our way down the river many handkerchiefs and scarfs (or is it scarves?) ﬂuttered farewell -
friends of the crew, tradesmen we had patronized, and an acquaintance or two. But most of the
people we have known at Luxor this winter are already gone. It was so lovely coming down
between poppy—covered banks. Have you ever heard of the poppies of Egypt? I never have. By
the "Indian billow", yes - but never by the waters of the Nile.

"I strew these opiate ﬂowers
On thy restless pillow;
They were plucked in Orient bowers
By the Indian billow.
May thy sleep be calm and deep
Like theirs who fell - not theirs who weep.“

White and pink and violet and red they stretched in vast ﬁelds and were a joy to look upon.

We got here about ﬁve and Doris and I immediately started for the temple on foot. Jones said it
was a "very short walk" and on this boat a very short walk means not more than ten minutes. But
it's a number of years since Jones went to the temple and he had forgotten. It was a good two
miles - a beautiful walk - after we had traversed the native village - with the most heavenly
evening light over miles and miles of emerald fields among which the road wound. But we got to
the temple just in time to see the sunset from the roof. Then there was only time to hurry through
the dim recesses of the temple itself, have a moment's glimpse of the most important crypt, the
colored one, and then start back. When we left the Beduin we had an escort of two sailors - 'on
our return journey we had a retinue of eight - two native men, two children and two goats having
joined. One of the native men strode in front of us to shoo off dogs and donkeys and people, and
all the rest followed in our wake. Doris and I chuckled consumedly at the idea of our tearing over
Afn'ca‘at nightfall with such a bodyguard. It was again augmented before we reached the boat by
two more of the crew who had been sent out to see if anything had happened to us. Here let me.
say, apropos of the gentleman who preceded us and ruthlessly cleared our path - I never can ’

43new set of rings every other week to wear upon his tattooed hands) dogging my steps.
Discovered, he drew nearer and practiced his English upon me. From his mutilated utterances I
gleaned that his name was Mourse, that his home was Cairo, and that I was a nice lady. There
was no village in sight but a ﬂock of brown sheep were feeding on the herbage upon the slope
near the river, and were being minded by a group of women and some little children who said
"How-do, how-do" as I passed by. Coming back the wind was against us and I reached the
Beduin in a state of heat and fatigue, and with that sense of virtue that one has after having taken
a walk one didn't want to take. The wind fell late in the aftemoon and we went a few miles
farther down before tying up for the night near Silaileh. Yesterday a sandbar and the bridge at
Esneh furnished our chief excitements. The sandbar held us fast for an hour or more, and it was
amusing to watch the various tactics employed to get us aﬂoat. Once some of the crew took off
their turbans, stripped to the waist, went into the river and set their splendid shoulders against the
boat (the Beduin herself actually got stuck that time) and pushed. It's queer, but these men look
much more undressed without their turbans than without their clothes.

At the Esneh bridge we cut loose temporarily from our tug and were warped through, stern ﬁrst,
with ropes, the tug following; and so avoided a repetition of the accident going up. We tied up
for the night on the east bank opposite a small town some distance above Erment. Coming down
from there this morning it was perfectly lovely. We got here too late to go to church, and I've not
been off the boat all day. Doris went this aﬁemoon for a last look at Kamak.

Monday, March 10. Our hours here are numbered and I feel as though I couldn't let them go.

For some reason it’s nice to be departing - for we are really now turning our faces homeward and
there are Italy and England to be taken in by the way, but there's so much here that I‘ve not really
seen - and the place itself is so hauntingly beautiful. I thank Heaven that mine eyes have seen it.
Cousin Theodore and Doris went for one more ride this aﬁemoon, but I had to do the society act
for the family - going out to say good-bye to the teachers at the Mission School, and then to tea
with the Contessa. That poor lady, instead of going to Cairo immediately aﬁer our departure for
Aswan — as she intended - was ill in bed for a week and looks quite shocking. We had a charming
time together and tea out in the garden. She says that Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in
Upper Egypt, says that our ﬁnds this winter have been the only ones of any importance in this
region. The men at the American House (i.e., the Metropolitan Museum diggers) have found
nothing but triﬂes like beads, etc. Lord Camarvon and his digger - the captions Mr. Howard
Carter - have been working like mad for weeks without stopping at all for the weekly holiday, and
with a force of 300, and have found nothing. "And Camarvon bears it", says Mr. Tremaine, who
has somehow been completely hypnotized by that degenerate peer, "as only Camarvon could!"
Having lofty souls ourselves we are sorry the others have been unsuccessful, bgt, considering how
Howard Carter sneered to us one day about Harry Burton's capacity as a digger, we are too
enchanted that it was Harry who made the important ﬁnds, and Harry himself is so happy he looks
like a different man. '

Tuesday, March 11. And our last day at Luxor - a perfectly beautiful one like so many, many that
have preceded it. Harry came over from the valley quite early to spend theday and make his ﬁnal
report about the diggings which closed down yesterday. He stopped work ad Medinet Habu a
week ago, and spent the ﬁnal week clearing up things in Siphtah where he found alabaster
fragments which, when pieced together, made 18 Ushabti! He presently crossed over to Luxor to
pick up Cousin Emma and Doris who had gone there, and at luncheon time they had much tittle-
tattle to communicate. They had encountered the youngest son of the German Emperor, and
Doris was rejoicing that she was not a Royal Prince, if they looked like that - with positively no
chin at all.

42"died man" on the island. We had to row back as the two men managing the boat were afraid to
sail her in a ﬁerce and contrary wind, which incidentally fairly blew our luncheon out of our
mouths. It was such heart-breaking work, the rowing, that I made the men land us on a sandy
point some distance from our destination. And I would not have missed a close inspection of that
sand for much. It was turquoise blue and golden yellow. I don't expect to be believed, and if
Doris hadn't seen it too, I would have thought I had gone color mad. We came home in a boat
rowed by savages, one of whom beat upon a drum made of a hide stretched over a broken water
jar, and sang wild ditties of his tribe I should imagine. The tiller of the boat was managed by a
black baby aged about ﬁve. Shortly after we started on our downward voyage there shot out
from a cove three tiny boats made of tin, in each of which sat a coal black little boy, two of whom
were naked and the third jauntily attired in a turban and very short waistcoat. They paddled their
crafts with tin disks, one in each hand. They pursued us madly demanding backshish, which of
course they got. It has been a marvelous expedition.

Thursday, March 6. The wind apparently blows all the time at Aswan and dries one up so you
have to use pounds of cold cream. We shiﬁed our position this moming, leaving the channel
between Elephantine and the Cataract House, and moving over to the other side of Elephantine
and tying up opposite the Grenfell tombs. The felucca took us over there aﬁer luncheon - Doris
and me — and two of the sailors helped us to climb the rather terriﬁc ﬂight of steps to the tombs.
The tombs are so simple and crude and archaic and different that we found them very interesting.
But the glorious views we had aﬁerwards interested me much more. We live so low down in our
dahabya that I‘m beginning to have a frantic craving for heights. So, the tombs duly visited, we
went on with our climbing. Doris and her sailor climbed to the very top and saw "hundreds of
miles" she said - off over the desert. My leﬁ leg still being somewhat stiff I stopped when part
way up and sat on a ruined wall on a spur of the hill and gazed down upon river and town and
desert, many sunbumed naked native towns, one perfectly superb sycamore tree, a train of camels
on a beach near the steamer landing, and a ﬂeet of snowy sails racing down the Nile. We were
sorry we didn't stay longer, for when back on the Beduin the wind made the deck untenable and
drove us below. We are off early tomorrow morning without having set foot on Elephantine! I
rejoice to think of the long river trip before we ﬁnally reach Cairo.

Love and love and love, my dears

Sunday, March 9.
West Bank at Luxor again.

Dearest Adeline:- Here we are once more, not exactly in the old spot, because we found that
usurped by an English dahabya - so we had to tie up a couple of boat lengths above. We arrived
about 10:30 this morning and it is all so beautiful. Doris and I love this part of the river much
more than those wild a lonely stretches near Aswan, and nowhere since we left here, eight days
ago, have we seen anything as superb as the Libyan Range. We left Aswan early Friday moming
with optimistic expectations of a smooth and rapid trip, having the current with us to aid our good
little tug. But it was a case of sitting on sandbars every little while, with a head wind that was a
gale and so heavy a "sea" on that it actually got too exciting, and so we sought as sheltered a spot
as we could ﬁnd and tied up about luncheon time in wait till the wind should fall. I took a walk
early in the afternoon but Doris declared such a proceeding much too energetic for her. Through
Haneen, as interpreter, I announced to the Rais (Arabic for Captain) that as I was only going to

distance a slight sound made me look behind and there was the dandy of the crew (he who buys a

41wind, a turbulent river and a thick grey atmosphere. We passed a mile of ﬂamingoes standing in
serried ranks upon the sands, and it was a marvelous sight, though owing to the mistiness of the
morning we could not see their color. It was very cold and the land looked very dreary and
nowhere as beautiful as at Luxor. We arrived at luncheon time and wound a tortuous way among
the titanic chaos of strange rocks that break the channel here, until we found a tying up place by a
little sandy island opposite the Cataract Hotel and near Elephantine. We cavalierly pushed a small
ﬁshing ﬂeet out of the cove we wanted, and if the language was as lurid as it was loud they must
have "cursed us out" quite thoroughly. The ducks nearly died with rapture when their coop was
opened and the river was once more theirs. And the chicken boy was kept busy tearing over to
other coves to shoe them back. Sir Francis and his ladies are born explorers.

Aﬁer luncheon Doris and I, with Amelie, Haneen and a sailor to see that nobody stole us, went
over (via the felucca) to the town and walked along the waterfront which is in itself much more
attractive than the one at Luxor. And the whole region is much more strange and wild and
savage, though much less majestically beautiﬁil. The sun had come out, the air was ﬁne and
bracing and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. To see the bazaar was what we really went for and
we were mad abbut it - not nearly so large of course as the one at Cairo, but - like the country -
so strange and savage with such bewildering things for sale - most of which we wanted. The
leopard skins ﬁlled me with covetousness, but are very expensive. I envied a Frenchman who had
a beauty under his arm as he stood bargaining for a stuffed crocodile. Haneen is an admirable
adjunct to shopping in the bazaars. He laughs sardonically whenever a merchant mentions a price
and if we really want the article he jabbers something in the vernacular, thrusts half the sum
demanded into the outstretched hand, and walks off with the amber beads or the dervish knife or
the Soudanese basket, and is allowed to go in peace. It's very cold here and we expected to sizzle
with heat. ‘

Thursday, March 5. Today Doris and I saw one of the wonders of the world - the great Aswan
Dam, which seemed to me an incredible achievement of engineering. We started immediately
after breakfast, taking a carriage at the Cataract Hotel, and with Haneen to carry our wraps and
the luncheon basket and do our talking. We plunged almost instantly from that highly civilized
hotel courtyard and gardens into an utterly desperate desert — a truly terrible place with none of
the beauty of the desert at Luxor. The ruined little habitations, the ruined little cemeteries, the
strange rocks with inscriptions scattered here and there, only added in my eyes to the general
horror of the desolation. There were about three miles of that and then, again with complete
abmptness, we found ourselves in a charming little oasis of a compound, with neat and pretty
bungalows, lovely trees and gardens and verdant terraces - the little village where the government
employees connected with the dam live. We walked across the barrage, a mile and a quarter, and
the little talking we did was done in exclamations. On one side, within eight feet of the top of the
barrage, lay the Nile in a placid lake. On the other, at least a hundred feet below, through a very
few of the 180 sluices the water thundered and leapt and boiled almost like Niagara at the base of
the falls, and then spread itself out in many streams that ﬂowed among the numberless wild
masses of strange rocks that make up the riverbed in that region. And stretching on all sides the
sand ridges of that fearful desert, sinister and with a look of eternal doom - the very edge of
Savage Africa.

At the far end of the barrage we took a crazy little felucca and sailed to Philae. Alas for that poor,
drowned "Pearl of Egypt"! We stepped out of our boat on to the roof of the temple, the tops of a
few palm trees were apparently ﬂoating on the water which lapped the very capitals of the
columns of that perfect kiosk. A keening and wailing came from one of the islands, and boats
were hastening towards it filled with women who looked like black crows. Haneen said there was

40better than to buy him and take him home. Conventions are such deadly stupid things - Doris and
Roger Would almost as soon have me dead as to see me riding about New Haven on a donkey
covered with red tassels, and yet it would give me such keen pleasure and be such pleasant,
moderate exercise. We got back to the Beduin at three and proceeded upon our lovely, watery
way.

Monday, March 3. It has been a perfectly horrid day with a lovely ending to it, and just one
pleasant incident in the horrid part. No sooner had we started this morning than we stuck on a
sandbar - that is, our tug stuck. As the Beduin draws only 14 inches of water she never sticks on
anything. When we ﬁnally got oﬁ‘ there were ﬁve other boats (native ones - high and dry on the
same bar. It was a grey morning and the air heavy and enervating. As we went through the gorge
of Silsileh we had an excellent view of the rock-hewn chapel of Horem-heb with its ﬁve doors and
that curious row of shrines, also rock-hewn, with the ﬁgures in them looking, as Miss Edwards .
says in her "Thousand Miles up the Nile", like people sitting in opera boxes. And then a perfectly
dreadful wind blew up and lashed the river into a ﬁiry of waves and whitecaps, and the air was ﬁll]
of sand and the landscape was more or less blotted out, and every bit of energy evaporated from

me. At about one we tied up just above Kom Ombo, both because Doris and I were to see the
temple, and also because navigation was too disagreeable.

There is a bank towering above us here where we are tied, and though the Beduin jerked and
strained most of the aﬁemoon, we were out of the direct path of the wind. Doris and I decided to
wait till after tea before going to the temple, in hopes that the wind would fall - which it did. The
one pleasant incident above referred to was a visit from a tiny black kid with long ﬂopping white
ears. He announced himself with some baby bleats and then trotted across the gangplank on to
the lower deck. We went out to see him; and he liked us so much that he kept coming back every
time the sailors herded him off the gang plank to the shore.

After tea Doris and I took Haneen and a sailor, climbed the bank, and two minutes walk along the
top of it brought us to the temple. The hour we spent there put us in tune again. It has the
unusual interest of being a duplex temple. If you drew a line straight through the center from
front to back you would have on each side of that line a complete temple with forecourt, hypostile
halls (large and small), vestibules, sanctuary and chambers. and the one on the right hand side is
dedicated to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk; and on the leﬁ, to Homar or Horceris (the
Elder Horns). The ﬁrst thing we saw on entering the forecourt was a little chapel in one room of
which is a pile of mummied crocodiles - quite shuddery. The temple is very ruinous, and the
reliefs, carved over every inch of it have departed from the pure, conventional lines of the best
Egyptian art and go in for realism with a result that is rather fat and unpleasant. Its chief glory in
our eyes is its site - directly on the edge of the Nile on the summit of a bank so loﬁy that it would
be a cliff if it were of rock, but being of earth, has had to be strongly reinforced to keep the whole
temple from gradually washing away at the time of the inundation. The views from the interior,
out through the splendid columns, of the river and the limitless desert beyond, are a wonder and a
joy. We climbed far up on a ruined pylon and sat there watching the gleaming river far below, the
Wisteria tint spreading over the sands of an island now void of the crocodiles that once infested it,
a long line of people going home to a village on the far shore, and then the sun sinking behind the
dim, dim, distant ridges of my beloved Libyan Mountains. And with the sinking of the sun the
cloudy sky ﬂamed into splendor. Somehow it all made me think of "the glory that was Greece“
quite as much as of the brutal majesty that was Egypt.

Tuesday, March 4. Aswan. We did not spend the night on the pylon, though I see I made no
mention of our coming down. We left Kom Ombo before we were up this morning, in a heavy

Much, much love to you all.

The Nile, Somewhere above Edﬁi

Dearest Adeline:- If the ﬁogs made as much noise in Pharoah's bedroom as they are making
outside of mine tonight I wonder he did not let the people go sooner. I never heard anything like
it. And just this minute the voice of ajackal was added to the row that has been going on every
second since 6:30 - it now being half-past ten.

Yesterday, aﬁer I ﬁnished my letter to you, we had an excitement. We were going through the
great bridge at Esneh when our tug made too sharp a turn before the dahabya got clear of the
tremendous piers or buttresses or whatever they are called. Everybody up above on the bridge
watching our transit began to jump and yell, the crew came ﬂying up on deck like the wind and
leaped like cats on the railing to try to push us oﬁ‘ as we rounded and crashed against the buttress.
Second Captain Mahommed, as he ﬂung his whole weight on his tiller, looked like a raging devil
- and undoubtedly has one inside of himself. There was not much damage done - some paint
removed and a few splinters, but that was all. And none of the crew hurt - to our great relief - I
thought one man was going to be mashed.

The rest of the afternoon's voyage "up south" as they say in this land of contradictions, proceeded
in peace with such exquisite beauty round about us that I wished I had been constructed "ﬁill of
eyes before and behind" like the Beast in Revelations. The ineffable light and color ﬁlled the very
air — like music. One new feature in the landscape was the Stockade-like structures made of dry
stalks (stalks of the dhurra, I fancy) put down along the sunny side of the shadufs to protect the
workers a little from the glare. We must have passed hundreds of shadufs yesterday and today.
They must weaken the bank greatly. This morning we heard a piece of the bank detach itself with
a boom like a cannon and drop into the Nile. We stopped at Edfu today so that Doris and I might
see the temple. We started this morning from our tying up place (the other side of El Kab) before
sunrise, but ran on to a sandbar and were much delayed, and it was luncheon time when we
reached Edﬁi. As soon as we had lunched Doris and I started, climbing a very steep and dusty
bank, covered with chicken feathers, at the top of which donkeys were awaiting us. Just how it is
managed to always have donkeys or carriages ready for us I don't know, but it always is. It's
Jones, I suppose. Beside the usual foot escort of donkey boys and a sailor we had a mounted one
consisting of Haneen and a native policeman. There was nothing attractive about the ride, which
took only ten or ﬁﬁeen minutes, and the heat was ﬁerce. But the temple is perfectly stunning;
probably the best preserved ancient monument in the world, Baedecker says. The gafﬁr who
showed us over the temple explained that its excellent state was due to its being "so modern" -
dating from 237 BC! In one of the ten small chambers opening from the corridor surrounding the
Sanctuary is a granite sacriﬁcial stone and he told us a tale concerning it which we can ﬁnd in
none of the guide books. He said that upon that stone were slain such people as were unfortunate
enough to have one red lock of hair among the dusky ones. "If man have one lock red hair he bad
man" he said. We saw the Nilometer outside the temple and we climbed to the roof of the temple,
where it was hotter than pepper but the view from which made it quite worth while.

The donkey I rode was the most heavenly animal I‘ve ever been on - a big, handsome grey
Sudanese donkey with a gait so smooth he hardly seemed to be moving. I would like nothing

38Friday, February 28. And our last day here until we stop on our way down to Cairo. I went
across to Luxor this morning to say good-bye to Mrs. Pier and have a ﬁnal scalp treatment. The
tonic they apply is made, they say, from the juice of the palm tree. This morning when the
German youth who has had recent charge of my sparse tresses dabbed on said tonic, I exclaimed
"Oh! that stings!" "Yes, madam, it is de stink of de palm" was his apt rejoinder.

Cousin Emma and I had a wondrous drive this aﬂemoon. Neither she nor I had been to the
diggings at Medinet Habu for weeks. When we announced we were going Cousin T. said he did
not wish us to as we would interfere with the work. He and Doris go over every other day, but
when we suggest going he seems to think that our presence will block everything. We took the
felucca and rowed down to the ferry landing where a carriage with two mules awaited us, and I
was internally much amused when Cousin Emma gave the driver the simple order "Medinet‘
Habu", for the Valley of the Queens was supposed to be our object. But we were crazy to see the
things Harry had excavated since our last visit - namely the palace of Rameses III. We found
Harry trying to take a photograph, while his hundred boys and men proceeded on their endless
procession to the dumping place. The throne room and three bathrooms are what have, thus far,
been brought to light. As the bathrooms open directly off the throne room, to the casual and
frivolous eye it would seem that the king divided his time between sitting on his throne and a-
washing of hisself. On our way to our carriage we were held up by a native who produced a
bandana tied up in a wad from which he took out four little carved bone images, which he told us,
in a scared whisper, came from Lord Camarvon's diggings. Cousin Emma wished to buy them for
Doris, but had forgotten her purse. The man agreed to take the entire contents of mine, though it
fell short of the ten shillings he asked. When too late we realized that this transaction leﬁ us with
no backshis for anybody. On we went to the Valley of the Queens - a lovely desert drive, and to
my eye a much happier valley than that of the Kings, because of the wide and beautiﬁrl view from
its entrance away down to the river and on to the far Arabian Mts. On our arrival at the tombs and
upon being confronted by the gafﬁr, we remembered we'd left our passes at home. But the magic
name of Davis opened the way. But th_en we fell back in the carriage explaining we had no
backshis. Broad smiles on the face of the gafﬁr and a courteous assurance that that made no
diﬂ‘erence. I wanted mainly to see the tomb of Nefertari so I went into that, and if that Queen
was as lovely as her pictures on those walls, Rameses II must have been crazy about her.

The drive back to the river was enchanting - the air so fresh, so calm, so scented, the barley ﬁelds
such a rejoicing green, everything so beautiﬁtl in the ecstatic light of afternoon. The river
reached, no backshis for the driver, but he was quite satisﬁed when we told him Mr. Jones would
attend to that (Jones is almost as much a name to conjure by as Davis. Also there was no felucca,
we having forgotten to tell it when to come back for us!

A Winter Palace boat clamored for the honor of taking us to our dahabya, brutally pushing aside
one lone tourist wishing to cross to said Palace. Just started in the Winter Palace boat, up dashed
our own felucca, the men rowing like mad, and we were transferred, the Winter Palace boatmen
perfectly satisﬁed when we said Mr. Jones would see them. The whole expedition was awfully
amusmg.

Saturday. On our way up the River. We "hit the trail" (as we used to say in my beloved wild
west) at 7:20 this morning, and it was high time for us to be moving, for Cousin Theodore was
getting tired of Luxor and very low in his mind. And again Doris and I are in the clutch of the,
enchantment of these wonderful shores slipping by us. Everybody is planting melons, even on the
sandbars in the middle of the river. I should think that later on the entire population would be
writhing with colic.

37I wonder if it's often given to human eyes to see anything more beautiful than the Libyan Range
was to mine as I saw it from the front terrace of the Winter Palace today in all the splendor and
the glamour of the late aﬁernoon light. It strikes me with fresh joy every time I look at it from
that particular place and at that hour. The Beduin has sunk so with the falling river that from the
salon we can no longer see even the tip-top of the Range, and even from the upper deck we do
not get it in its full majesty as they do from the Winter Palace. When we ﬁrst tied up here we
could see the Range and all the intervening stretch of desert and green from the salon window —
which will give you some idea of how the river has dropped.

When I got back to the Beduin I found Mrs. Pier and the Countess having tea. They had stopped
on their way home from an all day expedition to the Valley of the Tombs of the Apes. They had
asked Doris and me to go, but we declined because Cousin T. was not feeling well.

Thursday, Februag 27. This morning Cousin Emma and Doris went over to Luxor to see
Mohammed Mohassib and the Luxor temple, etc. while Cousin Theodore and I settled ourselves
with the dominoes on deck. In the middle of a game the sound of many bleats arose upon the air -
ranging from deep paternal ones to tiny appealing baby calls, and over the sands came a ﬂock of
dark brown sheep with four men and some children shepherding them. They came straight to the
little cove just at the stern of the Beduin. Three of the men stripped to the loincloth, and each
grabbed a sheep and walked into the river to wash it, while the children and the fourth man kept
the rest of the ﬂock together, and one small naked boy wrestled with a ram. It was a very
interesting sight and I was so annoyed when the native policeman, who spends his day over here

to see that no one steals our turkeys, strolled up and ordered them away from the sacred precincts
of the dahabya.

This aftemoon Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings and I went for a long walk.
My Monday attempt proved that my leg is still too lame for riding. Away to the north, standing in
a row in the most obvious and posterish manner, with the far end of the Range as a background,
are three palm trees. They look exactly like the ﬁinny pictures of the African desert with an artist
up in one of them while a lion lashes his tail in front of a deserted easel below. Cousin Emma says
she has hated those palm trees for years, and even I have got deadly tired of them this winter. So
I walked to them to see if I liked them better at close range. The ﬁrst part of the walk led along
the sands by the river's edge where the natives are planting their melons. Vast stretches of little
hillocks, with short bunches of dry cane in them to keep the sand together, show where melons
have already been planted, and little oblong bunches, about the size of a large watermelon, show
where others are to be planted. There ought to be an enormous crop in this immediate vicinity
alone. Then I struck inland past a native village which has always looked so charming in the
distance and which was very squalid really. Along a little ridge broken by shadufs and a
complaining sakiheh around which a cow toiled. I like them best when a camel is working them.
Camels always look so absolutely superior to anything they may be doing. I heard such a nice
reason the other day for the superciliousness of the camel. Allah has one hundred names - the
Faithful know ninety-nine of them but the camel knows the hundredth!...Then I cut across a
cultivated little gully, climbed up the other side and, behold, the three palm trees, looking quite
lovely and presiding over the very verdant outskirts of a tiny village. I came back another way
and was ready for quarts of tea when I got here.

36This aﬁemoon Cousin Emma and I, in response to the Contessa‘s importunities, went over and
teaed with her in the Luxor Hotel gardens. She was very hoarse and the ground was very damp,
but the sunshine lovely, the tea delicious and there were three other guests, quite charming — Lady
Baring, Mrs. Murray and the Countess Pauline Pappenheim. I talked to the latter all the time, and
I'm thankﬁil I don't fall in love with men as easily as I do with women. The Countess Pauline is a
girl aﬁer my own heart - about Doris's age, I should think, and with a very noble sort of beauty,
and too sweet. She told me she was half American - that her mother was a Philadelphian, but I

don't know who. And all this time I've been skipping yesterday which may be brieﬂy summarized
as follows:

The boisterous Mr. Whymper came to breakfast. (I've decided all that excitable volubility is his
company manner, because when he crosses over with Doris and me in the felucca on our way to
church he is quite pleasantly quiet, and his face in repose is sad.) I went to church and after
service had a little talk with Mrs. Daniel Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle for whom I waited outside
”the door. Brought Mr. and Mrs. Pier home with me for luncheon. They grow more and more
delightﬁil. Two English ladies came to tea - Mrs. Morhouse, hushed and gentle and sweet - and
Mrs. Aylmer, who might easily be colonel of a regiment. I believe her husband is. Yesterday was
the warmest day we've had, I think, and today there has been a touch of Khamseen - the hot, thick
wind of Egypt. It made the sunset tonight one of opaque, almost suffocating gold.

Tuesday, Februagg 25. The comings and goings today have been crowded. Doris and I dashed
across the river immediately after breakfast to buy Soudanese beads together, and then I dashed
back again, leaving her to play with Dorothy Richardson. Just aﬁer I returned to the Beduin,
Harry arrived for his holiday, courteously wearing the necktie I crocheted for his Christmas
present. He presently crossed over to have his hair cut and pick up Doris. I was in the middle of
a game of dominoes when I heard a voice on the land side of us demanding "Is anybody at home?
Is anybody at home? Is Mrs. Newberry in? " and Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle descended
from a sand cart and entered via the gangplank. They'd been to the Ramesseum - or somewhere.
A brief visit and they departed aﬁer I'd shown them over the dahabya. Then Harry and Doris
came. Luncheon next. After which the two young people went for a sail. About 4 PM. who
should arrive - taking my breath away with the violence of the surprise - but Karl Weston
(Professor of Romance Languages at Williams) whom I last saw twelve years ago when we took
tea together in a chestnut tree at that queer place "Robinson" outside of Paris. Close on heels
came Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson, who had been asked to tea. Cousin
Theodore went below and couldn't see anybody. Then at 7:15 Doris, in her war paint, went
across the river to dine and dance at the Winter Palace - so it's been almost as hectic as some of
the days at home...Doris just back at 11.30 and says she Bostoned most of the evening with
Newton Byers - of 1912 Sheﬁ‘. — and saw the family of that Perfect Beauty, Radcliﬁ‘e Romeyn,
1912 Captain of the Yale Crew.

Wednesday, February 26. I called this aﬁemoon on the Romeyns on their steamer and was very
glad to see them, but was freshly impressed with how awful it would be to go about in a Cook's
party - inﬁnitely better though than not to go at all. Mrs. Romeyn said she had almost despaired
of seeing us because the only information Radcliffe could give her of our whereabouts when she
bade him good-bye, was that we "were travelling with some big bug on a private dahabya that tied
up anywhere it pleased along the Nile". They go on to Aswan tomorrow. I teaed at the Winter
Palace with Mr. Weston and had a lovely time. That is a most congenial young man, and it seems
absurd, when he lives in Williamstown and we in New Haven, that we should meet only once in
ten years or so in the top of chestnut trees in Paris, or at Hundred Gated Egyptian Thebes.

35we again passed the patriotic display of bunting that adorable Eleanor Pier, aged seven, said
"Whose birthday is this? Did you say it was President Taft's?"

The Dodges joined me at the Winter Palace and we had tea on the rear terrace, and it was awfully
nice to be with friends from my native state. Doris and Janet Dodge had spent the whole morning
together at Kamak, so Doris thought she would better ride to the diggings with Cousin T. instead
of coming to tea.

Now I'm going to wind up with two nice, appropriate little tales. Two or three years ago when
on the 22nd of February the Beduin was in her gala dress to do honor to the day, the Duke and
Duchess of Connaught, coming down the river from Aswan, thought it was in their honor, and did
everything except ﬁre a salute to express their appreciation of the attention! And once in the days
when my relatives had that superb dragoman Mohammed Sala (that was before Jones had
qualiﬁed as a dragoman) he was much offended that he had not been informed the day beforehand
that this important anniversary was pending. Hearing someone say at the breakfast table "This is
Washington's Birthday - the boat must be dressed", he hurried out. Returning he said to Cousin
Emma "Madam, the cook say it is not possible to prepare a ﬁtting luncheon for the day without
some notice." "I didn't want a special luncheon - the cook gives us too much to eat always, as it
is", said Madam. At the close of luncheon, entered Mohammed Sala, bearing a colossal cake with
the American ﬂag in colored frosting on it. He placed it on the table and with a look of deep
reproach at Cousin Emma, he announced "Le gateau pour Mr. Washington!" I had the pleasure
of seeing Mohammed Sala today. On getting into the felucca after leaving the Winter Palace, the
men held it while beckoning and calling to someone on the neighboring boat. Then Sala came
hurrying along the bank, stepped into the felucca and bowed low over my hand. He said he was
here “with one prince". Aﬁer an exchange of compliments he departed. He is usually with
important people. He was twice with the Empress of Austria, and she nearly killed him walking
out to the Pyramids from Cairo and back every morning before breakfast.

Goodnight, dears all,

Your devoted Mary

Monday,Februag 24.
West Bank at Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- The Contessa and I had planned to go on a picnic a deux to the tombs of the
Nobles today, but at breakfast time a boat brought a note saying a heavy cold on her chest
prevented her going. As I had on my hateful riding things (never donned except for my donkey) I
decided to take a ride anyway. Neither Doris nor Cousin Theodore would go with me, so I went
alone, quite thrilled because it was the ﬁrst time in ﬁﬂeen days that I had ridden. It was the dullest
ride I ever had. Wadi Halfa needed the inspiration of others of his kind. We started off with
Malimond tugging at his head and a sailor pushing from behind. Shouts, cluckings, gurglings had
no eﬂ‘ect whatever on him. Whacks simply made his hindquarters go suddenly sideways in the
disconcerting movement that almost unseats me. It took me an hour to get out to the Colossi, so

there I turned about, relinquishing the Valley of the Queens for which I was headed and which
I‘ve not yet seen. If Malimond and the sailor had even talked to each other it would have been

less depressing. I kept getting sadder and sadder and Egypt began to seem to me a lonely land of
Doom, when I was suddenly cheered by the sight of a camel loaded with trunks and making for
the American House. A camel can always pluck me out of melancholy. It was very hot coming
home and I had to keep my veil down to prevent breathing tiny black ﬂies.

34Rameses III. Senator Aldrich came to tea and gave us some authentic information as to the cause
of Mr. Morgan's erratic behavior. He says Mr. Morgan was far from well and was greatly
disappointed in his new dahabya "Kargeh" because she was so slow, and that everything seemed
to go wrong, and he got tired of the whole business and dashed back to Cairo.

Wednesday, February 19. Today I had a distinct sensation. I went over this aﬁemoon to the
Rameses III to call on Mrs. and Miss Byers, whom I found very pleasant - Miss Byers struck me
as being a quite rare and lovely person - and while there I saw no less a person than Rudyard
Kipling. It seemed so strange that that little (he's very short) commonplace looking man should
be packed with such extraordinary genius. I went on from the Rameses to the Winter Palace to
have tea with Mrs. Pier and Madam Legrain, and then home. And tonight Don's dined on the
Rameses with the Byers and then drove with them to Kamak to see that wondrous place in the
moonlight. She says it surpassed any moonlight vision she ever heard or dreamed of.

Thursday: February 20. The memory of today will always be a mingled one of the Contessa and
grateful warmth. The Contessa invited me to spend the day with her, so I went over about noon
and we sat and baked in the sheltered sunlight in the Luxor Hotel garden. It must be 15 or 20
degrees warmer on that side of the river than with us, and I've been hankering for the heat of the
sun to annihilate my aches. The Luxor Hotel itself is a gloomy place and I can't think why the
Contessa chooses to stay there. The garden is the only tolerable part. We had coffee there after
luncheon in the dismal dining room, and then we made a tour of the antiquity shops which I found
vastly amusing. Everywhere it was woe at Mr. Morgan's departure without even a look at things
that had been saved for him for weeks. It was at Hassan's at the end of our rounds, that I saw the
only things I really wanted. It's surprising how ephemeral many of one's desires prove themselves
if one refrains from plunging into buyingthe moment one gets to a strange place. Dozens of
things I thought fascinating when I ﬁrst began to look about the shops, I now pass with averted
gaze because they tire me so. But Hassan brought out ten little alabaster jars (tunbler shaped)
with a cartouche sunk in the side of each and colored blue, and an alabaster cover to each the size
and shape of a large cream peppermint, and I coveted them with my whole heart. But the price of
even one of the darling things was too much for me. Hassan's shop is quite a mansion with all his
treasures on the second ﬂoor. You mount a ﬂight of stone stairs which would be imposing if it
were not for the traces of many chickens, and while you are poking about among the antiques a
tiny page in red and white brings you coffee, of the best, in dainty cups. I brought the Contessa
home with me for tea.

Friday, February 21. And a perfectly commonplace day. Calls with Cousin Emma this aﬁernoon
and tea at the Winter Palace, which seems to be more or less packed with freaks at present -
ladies who wear thin white dresses with no petticoats and pose in the doorway with miles of
Egyptian sunlight behind them. On our way back to the Beduin the felucca was caught in the '
wash from the Aswan boat just coming down the river, and from the deck of it Mr. and Mrs.
Dodge and Janet waved.

Washing’ron's Birthday.- and a nice American day as beﬁts an American on February 22 wherever
she happens to be. I played dominoes all the morning and in the afternoon I crossed over to
Luxor, ordered a carriage, annexed those enchanting Pier children and drove out to the Savoy to
call on Mrs. Daniel Eaton. As we passed along the waterfront - "Children" said I, "do you know
why all the American boats are dressed in ﬂags today?" "No", said the sweet little voices. "You
don't know what day this is?" "No", expectantly and excitedly. "Why, it's Washington's Birthday".
"Oh, 151? Why, I don't believe Father and Mother know it." “Then you must tell them when we
get back". Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winlde were out, and we drove back again all too soon. As

33Cairo this morning in a special train. The Contessa, who was over here this aftemoon, says
Mohammed Mohassib almost fainted when she told him this morning that his prey had escaped
him and that he might now bring forth his treasures and let other people have a chance at them.

Ex-President Porfin'o Diaz, with a boatload of " greasy looking Mexicans" (I'm quoting my
daughter) has recently been tied up in front of Luxor. Dahabyas come and go and the Stars and
Stripes seem to preponderate at the mast heads.

And now I will end this weak decoction and crave everyone's indulgence.

Your devoted Mary

Sunday, February 16.
West Bank at Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- Today we could once more say joyfully, with the ﬁre-worshippers, "Lo! the
Lord Sun! " And if we had been without it for a month we could hardly have welcomed it more
gladly. Egypt would be an intolerable land if it were oﬁen gloomy weather. I'm sure everyone
would go mad and drown himself and herself and themselves in Old Nile. Doris went to church
alone this morning and brought back the Contessa to luncheon. She stayed a long time, and after
Cousin Theodore and Doris had gone for their ride, she held Cousin Emma and me enthralled, as
the three of us sat in the sunshine on deck, with the story of her ﬁrst husband's experiences and
death in Central Africa, whither he went with Stanley. When she had ﬁnished I felt literally tired
from my emotions. It was like a Henry Seton novel for interest and quite ghastly and heart-
rending. When I come home I'll tell the story to anyone who wants to hear it, but I do not want
to write it. The one time I laughed this aﬁemoon was at a scene on the bank. The black dog and
the yellow dog, who have constituted themselves guardians of the Beduin for the sake of the food
they get, started to ﬁght and were stopped by the turkey cock who, with all his feathers spread
and gobbling furiously, rustled in between them. It was really one of the fumiiest things I ever
saw.

Monday, Februam 17. Nothing much to record today except a furious wind which at one time
this morning seemed as though it would tear us from our moorings and blow us across the river.
Aﬁer luncheon I left the boat for the ﬁrst time in eight days and crossed over to Luxor in the
sailing felucca (and a dashing little sail it has) to see if an electrical treatment would relieve the
ache that had possession of me. I think it did somewhat. It felt good at the time anyway. Luxor
looked almost new to me - it had been so long since I saw it. The Hardys came to tea; they are
very agreeable, but it is much easier to imagine Mr. Hardy leading a diplomatic life than Mrs.

Tuesday. I missed a great treat today because of my rheumatism. Harry Burton invited Mr. and
Mrs. Pier and Doris and me over to the valley to luncheon and to see the sarcophagus lid in Siphta
which has at last been turned over under the supervision of one of Maspero‘s experts from the
museum. The Piers and Doris went and had a gorgeous time. The lid is something unknown in
the history of sarcophagi. There are four ﬁgures carved in relief upon it - the King is the central
ﬁgure and there is a little child at each shoulder. Then on one side of him is Isis, on the other
Nephtys, and scattered about somewhere are a crocodile and a snake.

After my luncheon I crossed to Luxor for electricity and on coming back found Doris had just
returned and was sitting on deck with Newton Byers, one of Roger's classmates, who has been
dragged, an unwilling victim, to Egypt by his family. They are on their way up the river on the

32side of the river in case he may want them. We drove out to Kamak to call on Mme. Legrain,
who says her husband is nearly dead showing princes and potentates about the ruins. We also
called on Mrs. Edgar but didn't see her. When we got back to Luxor cousin Emma came straight
home and I paused to refresh myself with tea and Mrs. Pier and to see the throngs at the Winter

Palace. Our haughty seclusion on the west bank is well enough in the long run, but I do like once
in a while to be in the thick of things.

Friday, Febmag 7. and an almost disagreeable day because of the wind. We meant to ride out to
the diggings, but the air was so thick with sand that Doris and I decided to keep to the waterway -
so we sailed up the Nile in the little felucca with four of the crew and enjoyed it immensely.

Farewell, dears all. With love and devotion
Mary

Febmary 15.
West Bank, Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- This letter ought really to be skipped and all of you may skip it without hurting
my feelings in the very least. Since my last, the Land of Egypt has been the House of Bondage to
me - the past week having been an unpleasant medley of broken engagements, frustrated plans,
homesickness and sciatica. At least I suppose sciatica is the gentle distemper that makes one's left
leg feel as though it had been skinned alive and all the muscles torn out slowly with hot forceps.
I've managed not to stay in bed and I've also managed to play dominoes, but I've not been up to
anything else, and in my off hours have shut myself up in my room, swathed in knitted things and
packed with hot water bags, and saying "Hame, hame, fain wad I be, Hame, hame in my ain
countree." To cap the climax we are actually having bad weather. It is now three days since the
sunshine has been wholly withdrawn and day before yesterday it actually rained all day;
fortunately only a gentle sprinkle - had it been a good New Haven downpour the mud village
opposite us would have dissolved before our eyes.

On Monday I was to have gone on a picnic to the Valley of the Queens with the Contessa and
Mrs. Pier, but Doris went in my place. On Tuesday I was to have teaed with Mrs. Daniel Eaton,
way up the river on the Arabia, but had to send a note saying I was too crippled to come. I hope
she will carry out her plan of spending a week on her way down.

The other day Doris rode with Dorothy Richardson over to the abode near Der-el-Bahn' which is
called indiﬂ‘erently "the American House" or "Mr. Morgan's House", and in which live the men
who are managing the Metropolitan excavations, and the wives of said men. When the girls got
there at ten o'clock the people were just about to have breakfast! As digging stops at four-thirty
they must have a short day at the Metropolitan Concession. Mr. Morgan's eccentric behavior has
caused a buzz of comment and conjecture. During the two or three days his dahabya lay here the
people at the American House spent their time in moving into tents and back again according to
messages from the Great Man as to whether he was or was not going out there to occupy. He
ﬁnally did not go. He had a party of ten on his boat whom he had invited to go to Khartoum and
somehow it leaked out that their lives were a burden to them because their host was so cross and
tyrannical. The Khartoum plan was suddenly abandoned and they merely tore up to Aswan and
back again, being gone only four days. Then Mr. Morgan engaged suites of rooms at the Winter
Palace for his party and before they had time to move into them he whisked them all down to

31Tuesday, Februag 4. Doris and I have had a perfect day. Harry elected to spend the holiday in
the valley and invited Doris and me to come out to see the tomb of Horemheb, which neither of us
had entered, and also that I might see the Siphtah sarcophagus, and then to lunch with him at the
House. We got up early and had breakfast at eight (nine is the usual hour) and were off on our
donkeys before the Cousins appeared. We rode via the landing place opposite Luxor and it was a
sight worth seeing. Two steamers had come in last night and scores upon scores of people were
bound for the valley and the hubbub and the color and the excitement! Scores and scores of
donkeys with their gay trappings, scores and scores of donkey boys in blue and white and a dash
of red on their chests, native policemen in khaki trying to keep order while their splendid camels
lay waiting for them in the background - carriages, sand carts - and everybody shouting and
talking at once. It was immensely amusing. I did enjoy my ride, and the light and the color on the
Libyan Range were of surpassing beauty, but so blinding that we had to lower our chiffon veils.

We rode ﬁrst to the House, to drop our donkeys and pick up Harry, and then we walked around
to the Valley of the Tombs. We went ﬁrst into Horemheb which is not a very easy tomb to enter,
as the once kingly ﬂights of steps leading down into it are not but crumbling masonry. But what
beauty of painted walls when once you have made the descent, and what a superb sarcophagus!
More interesting to me than the completed work were the walls where the designs were sketched
in merely, looking as though the artist hadjust laid down his crayon and his brushes and gone
home to luncheon. Horemheb is lighted by electricity - but Siphtah more appropriately by
reﬂected sunlight from a large mirror at the mouth. The chief interest in Siphtah is the
sarcophagus. They've not got the lid turned over yet, but the thing is very impressive from its
size. The inscriptions on it seemed to me to be done in rather an archaic manner, but Harry is of
the opinion that that is because red granite is such a difﬁcult medium.

It was horribly hot walking back to the House in the ﬁerce light of noon, but it's the sort of heat
one can stand if one's head and the back of one's neck are covered. We had a very gay luncheon
with Harry and Mr. Launcelot Crane, and a lovely ride home. As we passed Howard Carter's
diggings we were surprised to see that he was working his full force of 300 in spite of its being
the holiday. He was probably doing it under orders from Lord Camarvon. That rather damaged
nobleman was standing under an awning arrangement, leaning on his cane, surveying the
proceedings. When we reached the Beduin the Contessa was here and eight other people came
soon aﬁer. Two of them were the Masperos to say good-bye, as they start down the river in the
morning. Sir Gaston tells me that my Princess is the granddaughter of the old and famous Prince
Gortschokoff; that she is married to a commoner by whose name she is never called! My mind is
absorbed tonight between my passion for my Princess and my interest in the strange habits of
camels. I passed one on the road this aﬁemoon, which hated me instantly, and in order apparently

to express its utter loathing it threw up one of its stomachs and swallowed it again with the most
perfectly horrid noise I ever heard.

Wednesday, February 5. and Ash Wednesday too. I didn't go to church, but it was a self-denial
not to, so I hope it's all right. The only exciting thing that has happened today was when a
sailboat drew up at the side of the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet, friends of Doris's
and mine, whom we had supposed were at home in Cleveland, Ohio. I followed them back in my
boat to call on Mrs. Dodge. They are on their way up the River on one of Cook's steamers.

Thursday, Februam 8. and an entirely heavenly day as usual. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode
out to the diggings, and Cousin Emma and I donned our war paint, crossed over to Luxor and
took a carriage. We had some difficult in getting a nice looking one, because Mr. J. P. Morgan

has arrived in his dahabya and he keeps six carriages and six donkeys waiting all day long on each

30Luxor. We brought Miss Buchanan home to luncheon. She it is who built up the Mission School
(the American Mission) at Luxor, and who is head now of the larger one in Cairo, and whom
Cousin Theodore admires so profoundly. Everyone does, I think. A little, very plain little
woman, whose "outward semblance doth belie her soul's immensity". The beauty of that soul
makes itself apparent to all kinds of people. A Sheik from the desert who came to one of the
Commencements at the Mission School here said to one of the teachers, in speaking of Miss
Buchanan, "Today for the ﬁrst time in my life have I seen a Woman! How can I go back to those
three — my wives!"

This aﬁemoon the Fahnestocks came to tea and some English people named Rae puffed over in a
steam Launch ﬁ‘om Luxor, bringing Mohammed Mohassib. The old man enjoyed himself
enormously, sat in various chairs, chuckling at everything, insisted on drinking tea, because it was
the custom at this hour on this boat, though he disliked it greatly, and we were all telling him to
wait a few minutes and he should have some coffee. We were disappointed because he wasn't
cladin rich raiment — he being a millionaire - but he was bundled up in a brown and white checked
shawl around his neck and an old brown overcoat with a hood to it, such as our sailors wear at
night.

Monday, Februam 3. A heavenly day - like all the others that have gone before it. The wind
ceased suddenly last night before it had torn us from our moorings, and this morning dawned as
quietly as possible. Doris went over to Kamak for the forenoon with Margaret Fahnestock, and
in the afternoon she rode out to the diggings with Cousin Theodore, while I spent the aﬁemoon in
the novel and thrilling occupation of falling in love with a Russian Princess. The Contessa had
invited me to go to Kamak in a small party of which the Princess was one. We were to be shown
about by M. Legrain himself (he has for years been conducting the excavations at Kamak). But
that part fell throngh and it was Mme. Legrain who took us about, Legrain himself being absorbed
with a dissipated looking Prince de Croix. But little I cared as long as I could gaze upon my

Princess. Besides, I think we saw pretty much what we would have seen under Legrain's
guidance.

We watched the workmen carefully unearthing a large and beautiful jar from a ruined and
crumbling wall beyond the sacred lake. We held our breaths while it was being emptied, and let
them out again when nothing but a brick was found inside. We went to the little temple of Ptah in
one dusky room of which stands the uncanny black granite statue of Sekmet, the goddess with the
lion's head. When you have looked at her for ﬁve minutes she becomes so vibrant with life that it
is easy to understand why the Arabs believe that she sometimes prowls forth seeking whom she
may devour. My chief pleasure this aftemoon was watching the Princess - a fairy Princess, young,
little, beautiful, quiet, with a delightﬁil laugh and a perfect simplicity of manner. She looks like a
high bred Englishwoman except that her eyes are somehow different. Her skin is healthily tanned
with a lively color in it. She wore a most perfect pongee skirt, just off the white in tone, shoes to
match, a short. silk sweater coat of tawny orange, a hat like all our hats (bought in Cairo for $1.00)
with a long veil, like all our veils only of a lighter shade than her sweater, a cane with a
bloodstone sunk in the top of the handle, and a monocle on a black ribbon. She walked so well
on her little feet and when she took off her gloves later at tea in the garden of the Luxor Hotel,
her hands were covered with superb sapphires. Doris had seen her on the street in the morning,
was insantly antagonized by the monocle, and came home saying she was "a sight" and that her
donkey had shied at her. So much for the intolerance of youth. She is the Princess Gortschokoff
and she has me bound to her chariot wheels.

29good-looking husband asked for me. They were Mr. and Mrs. Packard - she a niece of Mrs.
William Famam, and very like her. They were very rushed, being in Luxor for a few hours only,
and I was so sorry not to see more of them.

Thursday, January 30. Doris and I had a lovely ride this afternoon. We went ﬁrst over to the
diggings to cheer Harry up a bit. He gets low in his mind if he doesn't see a white person to speak
to occasionally. We went by a short cut which Doris loves and I hate because there's a fearsome
plunge into a gully which I always descend shrieking "I want to get off - I want to get off! 0 how
I loathe this place! " While a sailor holds me on and Malimond says in that heavenly voice of his
"Don' be 'fraid Madame!" Yesterday the sailor and I took the plunge in a most lover-like manner,
for I was clutching him around the neck and he had his arm around my waist. Harry clamored for
us to stay, but we had a hankering to go somewhere we had not been before, so after a very big
visit we continued on our way and ﬁnally - or should I say shortly - reached the hollow in the hills
where nestles that gem of a temple (small enough for my limited comprehension) Der-el-Medineh.
Such lovely carving, such delicious color leﬁ in scraps and patches, and peace and remoteness
that I said "I would have liked to come here to church". And through a broad opening in the rocks
a wide and beautiﬁil view down to the distant Nile, with the stately ruin of the Ramesseum in the
foreground. We had only ﬁfteen minutes to spend there, but acquired that haunting desire to
return there which is, for me, an Egyptian fever. The splendid looking Arab, guardian of the
place, was so overcome by my largesse of seven and a half cents that he knocked Malimond out
of the way in order to hold my donkey himself when I mounted. We rode home by our dear
Colossi and Doris suddenly left me on a mad gallop to overtake a baby camel she saw in the
distance. I ﬁnally caught it up without any undue exertion. I don't believe it could have been
more than a month old. The maternal camel was not in the least gratiﬁed by our attentions and
tried to take a bite out of Doris. .

Friday, Januam 31. The only thing worthy of record today was tea, by invitation, with the

- Masperos on their Dahabya Min'am. It's a government boat and so ugly that I should think it
would afﬂict them desperately to have to live on it. However, I come back from every other boat
I see freshly impressed with the beauty and perfect order Of this one. Sir Gaston was very twinkly
this aﬁernoon but did not have the opportunity to launch forth upon one of his marvelous
monologues. We rowed home beneath a ﬂight of crimson clouds with the upper reaches of the
river rose and violet and the nearer ones ﬁre opal.

Good-bye till another week and so much love to all, whether in Edwards Street, on the dear
“hilltop, or in Summerville.

Your devoted Mary

Sunday, Febmag 2.
West Bank at Luxor

Dear Adeline:- There is such a wild wind from the desert tonight that the Beduin is rocking as
she never did during the entire voyage up from Cairo. Always immediately after dinner I come
into my room and hang out of my window for a few minutes to look at the stars and the lights of
Luxor. Tonight they are veiled in sand. The wind rose in the aﬁemoon. It was calm enough
when Doris and I went to church this morning. Upon emerging from the sanctuary I had a little
talk with Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Hutchins, Delia Porter'a relatives who are birds of passage through

28Tuesday, January 28. Harry came over early this morning (have I said that Tuesday is the weekly
holiday here?) and took Doris on an expedition to Kamak. Mr. Howard Carter came from his
diggings about eleven and stayed, politely quarreling with all of us, until time to escort Cousin

Emma and me to the Dahabya Cheops, just below us, where he and we were lunching with the
Fahnstocks.

Mr. Howard Carter merits a paragraph to himself. He is a young Englishman and one of the very
best diggers in Egypt. He used to dig for Cousin Theodore until they quarreled (n_ot politely, I
fear). Now he digs for lord Carnarvon. He can be perfectly chamiing, I'm told. This morning he
was probably liverish for he disagreed with everything that was said. Fleas were mentioned. He
said there were no ﬂeas in this part of Egypt! Cousin Emma then asserted that there were even
worse things than ﬂeas in this part of Egypt. He insisted on knowing what she meant. Goaded to
desperation she ﬁnally replied succinctly "Flesh-lice". "You can't acquire those", said he, "they
are parasites. The develop on the bodies of the persons who have them." "I've had them! ” said
the dainty little lady. "You can't have had them", asserted Mr. Carter. "Play ﬂigt piece!" he said,
pouncing on me as I was playing dominoes with Cousin T; it annoys me excessively to be watched
when I'm playing dominoes, and more so to be ordered about during the process. So I played
another piece and lost the game. "Why didn't you play the piece I told you to?" he demanded. (It
was the ﬁrst time I had ever talked to the man in my life.) "Because you told me to", I replied.
Whereupon he laughed and began to be pleasant. The luncheon with the Fahnstocks was very
agreeable, but with oceans too much to eat. I sat between an Italian Count.who is here buying up
lands to start a Franciscan or Dominican (I don't know which) monastery, and Mr. Tremaine (the
Contessa was at the other end of the table.) Mr. Tremaine is beginning to assume godlike

proportions in my mind since he told me that "one of his homes" is in Cornwall and that he owns a
magniﬁcent cliff near Tintagel. Think of owning a piece of that rapturous coast!

This evening Doris has, I'm happy to say, gone to dine with those lovely Piers at the Winter
Palace and to stay for the dance aﬁerwards.

Wednesday, Januagy 29. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings this morning and I
mended frantically until time to put on my very swagger serge (made by Hamilton & Co. of
Chapel St., and a credit to them) and go over to the Winter Palace to lunch with the Piers. The
little girls lunched with us - as I hoped they would - and each one of them gave me a lovely pink
rose. They looked like lovely pink roses themselves. Nothing on earth could be sweeter than they
are. We had a charming time, and then I got a carriage and drove Mrs. Pier out to the American
Mission School in which the Cousins have been so interested for years. Cousin T. always keeps
seven orphan girls there. As soon as any are graduated others take their place. There are three
American women teachers, a Scotch housekeeper and a number of native women teachers. The
chief diﬁiculty in the mechanism of the school is the feeding of the pupils - each meal has to be
served in three sections, according to caste, and with different food for each caste. It's a ﬁne new
building extending around a square court, and most of the rooms are light and airy. They, the
teachers, insisted upon our having tea with them and gave us some delicious Scotch Shortcake and
another kind of cake - quite the best I've had in Egypt. Then I came home and had another tea,
Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero being here for that function. He is surely one of the most delightﬁil
men in all the wide world. I fancy Lady M. is very agreeable when with people who canjabber
French but she will not exert herself in the least for those who move haltingly through the mazes
of the Gallic tongue. She allowed herself a moment of enthusiasm when we were hanging over
the rail watching the ducks, who know as well as anyone when it's teatime. "Comme il est
enorme, le gros!" was almost the only spontaneous remark I heard her make. In the middle of the
Masperos‘ visit a steam launch came pufﬁng and clattering up and a beautiful woman and her

West Bank at Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- How does that Watts hymn go? "Oh day so calm, so still, so bright" - I don't
believe I've got it right and very likely it wasn't Watts who perpetrated it, but anyway "so calm, so
still, so bright" describes all our Sundays here (and all other days except when the wind blows).
"So still" did not exactly depict the part of the morning when Mr. Whymper was breakfasting with
us. He is awfully nice and very amusing - but Dio Mio! what a voice! The whole boat was ﬁlled
with the sound thereof and I could see Cousin Theodore wilt beneath it. Rarely have I met
anyone who dislikes as much as does Charles W. to have anyone else talk, so when he is present
there is little respite from that battering sound. I'm beginning to understand why his lawful and
wedded doesn't live with him, but resides somewhere in the country in England with the daughter,
and occasionally allows Charles to pay them a visit. He and Doris and I rowed over to church
together. Our regular incumbent was absent, preaching in the Cathedral at Khartoum, and we had
two clerical birds of passage in his place. The sermon, an excellent one, was preached by the Rev.
Urquhart Bing Urquhart (isn't that a delicious name?) And the service was read by a little man
who looked like an owl but who had a chamiing voice and read beautifully. In connection with
him Mr.Whymper told us such a nice little tale. He - the Rev. Owl (I forget his name) is rector in
a little town in England called Dunmow (where General Bing, now commanding all the forces in
Egypt, lives when he's at home). And there it has been a custom from time immemorial, to give
once a year a whole ﬂitch of bacon to the married couple who on that day can, with their hands
upon the altar, swear solemnmly that for the preceding year not a single cross word has passed
between them! If more than one couple present themselves and take this solemn oath, whichever
one can best substantiate the assertion receives the ﬂitch of bacon.

Mr. Tremaine came home to luncheon with us and I'm sure had a very dull time. No - he didn't
come with us, he followed later, and the Contessa was to have come with him but had a bad
headache and couldn't, and he looked almost dismembered without her. Doris rode over to the
diggings at Medinet Habu this aﬁemoon with her donkey boy and a sailor. She and I had a lovely
ride yesterday afternoon around by the Ramesseum and home by the Colossi, where we paused
and got off to examine the creatures, which we have not done before. When we reached the
Beduin we found Mrs. Pier and her two little girls. Those little girls are the very sweetest things
I've seen in ages. They were having a heavenly time in our poultry yard as we rode up.

Monday, Januam 27. I foresee that this letter is going to be dull for anyone to read, for I don't
seem to be doing anything off the boat just now except society things. (I'm lunching out
tomorrow and the next day). I literally did not step oﬁ‘ the boat till late this aﬁemoon when
Cousin Theodore and I went on the sands for a walk which he thought long and I thought short.
We were all to have gone over to the diggings this aﬁemoon, Cousin Emma in her donkey chair
and we on our mounts, but just as we were all ready to start Cousin T. said he had a headache and
wouldn't go, so I stayed at home with him, and the others went. At teatime they returned in a sort
of whirlwind of donkeys and people, having picked up the Contessa and Mr.Tremaine and their
outrunners. And at the same time a boat drew up on the other side of the Beduin. and deposited a
very channing Englishwoman - a Mrs.Graham, whose husband belongs to the Civil Service in
Egypt, and who is an old acquaintance of the cousins. Poor Cousin Theodore was reduced

almost to a panic, as he always is nowadays by the arrival of people. I admired Mrs. Graham
vastly, in spite of an absolutely expressionless way of speaking which I generally ﬁnd irritating
when I meet it. Something quite thrilling was told her by Mr. Tremaine, and she murmured in a
perfectly colorless voice "How exciting" as she buried her nose in her teacup.

26thorn bushes of the desert he drew the snakes and never once when he would pounce on a rock
and turn it over did he fail to ﬁnd a scorpion. And the scorpions stung him and the snakes bit him,
and then he would drop them into a strong basket with a weighted plug-like stopper to it, and a
cord handle to carry it by. We lunched in one of the side rooms of the temple and when rested
and comfortably full of bread and butter and sardines and pate de foie gras and cake and ginger
ale and Turkish coffee, we rose up and demanded a cobra. It was against the rules to hunt for it
in the temple, Maspero having forbidden it, but we did it. Through one great court we followed
the Arab and his incantation, then into another, and when he began pushing his sleeves up to his
shoulders we knew he smelled his quarry (that's what he does - he smells them). He stepped from
ruined wall to ruined wall and suddenly bent forward with what sounded like a shout of
command, and out from a crack between two great blocks of stone slid the wicked head of a
cobra. With a jerk of his stick the Arab brought the four feet of reptile out and it slipped and
curved over the pavement, then raised its head, spread its hood and struck. It didn't hit anything
but I heard its jaws come together. Then the Arab picked it up and showed us its fangs and it
struck again, leaving drops of poison on his sleeve. Then the Contessa took it and holding it
tightly just back of the venomous head she put it around her neck. It was, to me, an absolutely
revolting spectacle.

She and Mr. Tremaine both wear charms that the Arab has given them. I asked Mr. Tremaine to
tell me as man to man whether or not he believed in his charm. To which he replied that this
much he knew — that not for anything would the Arab let any of the rest of us, who had no charm,
handle the snakes which he permitted him and the Contessa to take hold of freely. His theory is
that the charms are saturated with some kind of essence of snake which the snakes smell and
which renders the wearers more or less immune. The show over we all ambled home in a rather
spectacular train in the lovely sunlight across the Memnonian plain. And Cousin Theodore didn't
believe a word of it.

Wednesday, J anuary 22. This aﬁemoon I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace -
mixed doubles. My partner was a very. nice Scotsman named MacNaughton, and we defeated
English lords and German baronesses and commoners like ourselves, and won the ﬁrst prize. And
not a Yale athlete of them all can boast a cup like mine. It pursued me in a boat from the Winter
Palace, for I had beaten a modest retreat, not knowing that I had won anything.

Friday, June 24. Yesterday Doris and I had a lovely afternoon. Mrs. Pier had invited us over to
the Winter Palace for the Gym Khana, and we sat and baked in the sunshine and were much
amused watching the sports and the crowds of people. Luxor seems very full just now and there
are two or three American dahabyas tied up on that side, though I don't know who is on them.

Today, in the aﬁemoon, Cousin T., Doris and I rode over to our new diggings at Medinet Habu.
Harry began there yesterday and says he is glad to be working above ground. The children who
were carrying off the dirt were all singing some sort of chant. "Have they been singing like that
all day? " I asked. "Oh, no!" said Harry,"they are simply singing 'The Boss has come, the Boss has
come."' The light was perfectly exquisite as it fell on Lybian Cliffs, on stately temple walls, on
heaps of rubbish, on spots of truly emerald verdure, on a lonely Coptic Monastery far off in the
desert, and on one splendid Beduin swinging on his camel over the sands toward the western sun,

twirling his camel stick in the air.

Good-bye, dears all, till another week.
Your devoted Mary

25My own doings today have been of the humblest compared with the brilliant career of my
daughter. I spent the whole morning straightening out Cousin Theodore’s bank account, and
when I had ﬁnished my temperature was 120. After luncheon, to clear my brain and get some
much needed exercise, I went forth on a long walk with a sailor at my heels. I saw lovely things -
stretches of sloping river bank clothed in bean plants blossoming forth in stylish black and white
ﬂowers, great ﬁelds of peas with their reddish violet blooms, some brown little boys entirely nude
who dived frantically for their shabby garments when they saw me coming. Then home packed
with ﬂeas which I had annexed in a native village through which my walk led me.

On the deck of the Beduin in the lovely aﬁemoon light, I found the Contessa Contardone and Mr.
Tremaine taking tea with Cousin Emma. Another guest arrived on a donkey, Dr. Alan Gardiner,
an Englishman eminent for something but I don't know what. All I know is that he's much too fat.

And then our ears were smitten with an appalling though distant bray and we knew our family
was approaching. They looked like pictures of explorers returning from the heart of Aﬁ’ica as
they came in single ﬁle across the sand the baggage donkey at the head. Doris was beaming,
Maspero had pronounced the sarcophagus superlatively ﬁne - saying there was only one other like
it. He was unwilling to have the lid (lying face downward on the ground beside it) turned over
without the utmost care and is sending to Cairo for the proper apparatus. He wants the
sarcophagus for the Cairo Museum, M he wants Cousin T. to pay for its transportation thither
(he says it will cost 250 pounds sterling to do it) and Cousin T. does not at the moment feel
inclined to do it. Maspero and Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, lunched at
the House in the Valley with Cousin T., Doris and Harry Burton, and Doris says it was the treat
of a lifetime to hear Maspero talk, which he did from one o'clock till three-thirty. He talked about
Egypt and excavations, about Louis Quatorze brocades, about Chinese porcelains, about music,
about the way the Cretan women dress their hair, about Sevres enamel, about most of the

beautiful and interesting things in the world. Isn't it simply splendid that Don's could have had
such an experience?

Tuesday, Januagg 21. This m been a day! Some of the narrative of its events may tax your
credulity but I shall tell things simply as I saw them. The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on
a picnic to Medinet Habu, and we agreed to meet her out there at eleven o'clock. We started
gaily forth at ten with Nobi, Malimond and one of our sailors as escort. Doris has changed the
name of her donkey (which some idiot had christened "Lovely—Sweet") to Hermes, because he
goes so fast. My new mount, Wadi Halfa, the nefarious Sugar's successor, is a jewel, and I now
see delectable ambles spreading out on an almost endless vista before me. We had gone only a
short distance when Doris had a nasty spill. Her donkey stepped in a pitfall (forgetting that he
was supposed to have wings to his heels), threw her, fell on her and kicked her - not viciously but
in his struggles to get up. She declared she was not hurt and insisted on proceeding to the picnic.
(A lame shoulder for two days was the only bad result). Promptness being one of our petty
vices, we were of course the ﬁrst at the rendezvous. The Contessa and the rest of the picnic did
not arrive till quarter of twelve. But who would mind waiting indeﬁnitely at Medinet Habu on a
glorious day? The Contessa brought with her to entertain her guests the Snake Charmer of
Esneh, whom she had summoned down for the purpose. We started out at once skirting the
Coptic ruins which lie close to the southwest walls of the temple. Walking with leisurely steps in
advance of us went the stately ﬁgure of the Arab in his black robe and white turban, with the
ordinary long stick of the camel driver in his hand. Behind him stalked the Contessa all in white
from her snowy, ﬂoating veil to her spotless shoes (which didn't stay spotless), smoking one
cigarette after another. The rest of us, ten in number, came on by twos and threes, looking
perfectly commonplace in our ordinary donkey clothes. Over the burning sands we went under
the burning sun, while the Arab in a loud clear voice recited a sort of incantation. And from the

24victim no chance of escape if he happens to be sitting by the window, as this one was. We had a
delightﬁil half or three-quarters of an hour with him while he tore up and down his room and
ranted with a pipe in his mouth and a checked cap on his head (except when he periodically
remembered and took it off only to clap it on again in a ﬁt of abstraction). He mimicked people
looking at pictures, and birds in their native haunts till you could see the latter quite as distinctly
as the former. And he showed us some lovely things he had painted. One gem of Medamet is
tearing me to pieces. Its price is just the sum of a check Mrs. Thompson gave me for Christmas,
but a conﬂict rages in my "buzzum" because I had determined to buy with it some piece of
jewelry, and I can't make up my mind which could give me the greater and more lasting
satisfaction. I have a barbaric fondness for jewels.

This aﬁemoon the donkeys were brought over to this side of the river and we three were to have
ridden to Medinet Habu. But the wind blew up and Cousin Theodore wouldn't go and made such
a row about Doris and me going that we compromised and I stayed at home.

And now Al Allah for this week, and dear love to you all.
Mary

Sunday night, January 19.
West Bank, Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- We have with us again the moon silvering the surface of the Nile, tuming the
desert sands to snow and driving the dogs of Luxor mad. At least I suppose it is the moon. It
certainly is not joie de vivre which makes them bark, for the poor things haven‘t any. But Kim
ﬂying up Orange Street frenziedly barking at the Victoria containing Mr. Justice Hotchkiss (a
spectacle Kim always ﬁnds intolerable) does not make more of a row than each and every canine
dwelling across the river on those nights when "the moon cloth with delight look round her."

Doris and I went to church this lovely moming and managed to be late, which was wholly
unnecessary as we had been sitting on deck waiting for the time to get into the felucca and be
rowed over. Mr. Whymper was also late and came racing aﬁer us as we neared the church door,
and we all hurried in together without his having a chance to criticise our clothes. "What's this
for? And what's the meaning of that? Women wear such rummy clothes!" He observes in an
amused voice, usually when he meets us.

When we got back to the Beduin at luncheon time we found a very nice batch of letters from
home - yours of the 3 lst December, Adeline dear, for which so many, many thanks, was one, and
another from Susan in Sumrnerville giving unstintingly the hallmark of her approval of Doris and
my devotion to that dear place.

About half past four a cavalcade started for the valley. Cousin T., Doris and Jones mounted on
their respective donkeys, and my new donkey loaded with luggage and groceries instead of with
me. And tomorrow morning that matchless trio of Egyptologists - G. Maspero, T. Davis and D.
Newberry - will pass ﬁnal judgment upon the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah.
Cousin Emma and I heroically remained behind to dispense tea and cakes to some people named
Sprague from Buffalo, who had brought letters and whom Cousin T. refused to be bothered with.
They brought a young niece, Alice Keating, with them, whom I liked. Mr. Sprague reminded me
somewhat of "The Man from Home" and he certainly voiced my feelings when he said that in this
land he was "completely dazed by the enormous amount of what he didn't know".
