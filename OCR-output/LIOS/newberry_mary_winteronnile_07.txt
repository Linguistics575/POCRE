tired she was beginning to hate everything. We all thought it was worth journeying to Naples
simply to see that bronze "Hermes Resting", found at Herculaneum.

Yesterday, another very beautiful day, we sailed, oﬂicially at noon but really not till two. The .
delay was caused by a tragedy. A poor sailor or stevedore was killed when some cargo was being
lowered into the hold, and we had to wait until the city authorities would let us go. Doris and
Harry Burton and I stood long on deck as we moved out of that superb harbor, and when we had
sailed past Capri all the perfect beauty of the unparalleled coast unrolled before us, its_many Cities
and hamlets lying white in the shadow and pink in the sunlight. We were almost certain we could
pick out the spot where

"Sits Amalﬁ in the heat

Bathing ever her white feet W

In the tideless summer seas." '
If My we can take that drive when we come back!

We passed Stromboli near midnight, but it was sleeping so there was nothing to see but a huge
black cone rising out of the sea. And m were sleeping when we threaded the Straits of Messma.

We are very comfortable on this steamer, though not as luxurious as on the Berlin. All these
German boats feed you to death. You could stuﬂ‘ till you burst if you were so "dispoged". There
is everything on the menus to which the plain American has been accustomed from infancy
(including "corned beef hache Americaine") as well as everything you never heard of from
"Spitcake" to "Lobskaus with dilled cucumber".

And a mighty indolence is upon me, body and mind. My spectacles are broken and I can't see to
read Baedecker's Egypt, and rejoice that I can't.

There was a sunset last night that steeped our very souls in color. It ﬁlled the heavens, glittering
gold in the west and mother-of-pearl in the east, while liquid opal shifted and vanished on the sea.
Today it has been a calm sea and delicious warmth and a far dim glimpse of Crete. Tomorrow it
ought to be Alexandria about noon and Cairo in time for dinner. And I hope that when we reach

Cairo Doris and I will be able to remember that we are puﬂick ladies and keep from shrieking
with delight.

The moment we reached the hotel at Naples I posted 24 letters and notes I had written on the
steamer, and Heaven send that they all reach their various destinations. You - all of you who read
this - ought to have heard from me before this reaches you.

Dear love from your ever devoted
Mary

Oh, Adeline, and Oh, Augustus, and Oh, All You Other Dear People who read this letter - I
Simply love this land to death! Why did I say that Algeciras was "the white city of a dream"?
Because I would so much rather have said it about Alexandria! It was so perfectly heavenly when
