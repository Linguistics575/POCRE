offered me the gardener's cottage for the summer! Even the presence
of Cecile who arrived last evening with Terry, did not seem to
console him for my departure. H looked so shocking this morning it

sent my heart into my mouth.

I'm afraid it's going to be horribly hot in New Haven, but with
escape before me I suppose I can stand it. I'm longing for your
first letter. Please give my regards to Mrs. Morris and tell her
how much I appreciate her hospitality to you.
God bless my boy.
Your loving
Him.

Best Beloved — g It was a joyful surprise to get your letter
from Kansas City, and I hope mine to you from Newport reached you
before you left Denver for Leadville. I got back from Eewport

last Tuesday and on Friday Went up to The Hill (Cobalt, Conn.) to
spend the night with the Taylors. I had positively promised them a
visit so I had to go. Henry Devereux was there and we had a nice

old fashioned Colorado time, and the next;day they motored me all the
way down here, and I gave them inocuous drinks at the Lawn Club before
they returned to The Hill.

Doris and Julia got off at noon yesterday, and D. said she would wire
me when they arrived at Castine this morning, but no telegram has
come, and I'm so anxious I've telegraphed hrs. Balter to ask if they
got there. Kan Hart has sent me an enlargement of that lovely picture
of D. on horseback with the mountains behind her. It's a perfect
beauty and I'm so pleased. I sent out to see him this afternoon nn‘
he, too, was a vision of beauty in my eyes. He had just been bathed
and he was a reddish fluff. He almost ate me up, talking hysterically
until he was exhausted and flopped flat on his little tummy on the
floor, thumping his tail and rolling the whites of his eyes at me.

If we find the boarding home at Castine will let us have him We are
going to_have him sent up. . . > r

I hope to get off on Wednesday stopping two days at Springfield (or ;
rather Blandford near there) with Paige. My accommodations on the

boat from Boston are engaged for the night of the 4th. Castin, Raine

will be our simple address. When you write tell me every detail -
vnothing will be too small to interest me. I do hope you'll like it.

Uncle frank and Aunt Lida want you to stop and make them a risit in
Denver on your way home in case they are back there from the East.

\

I paid the bill at once. God bless my boy and keep him safe.

Your loving Kim
