Your letter of the 21 Nov. reached me Saturday the 7th and rejoiced me?
through and through. I'm also glad that you hzxve decided to live at th

'W'e go on living in the Arabian Nights. he had tea yesterday afternoon
on the dahabeah, with the most wonderful lights on the river- that haun
ing river Nile; white \:alled palaces, backed by towering palm trees,

gleaming out on the opposite shore; a fleet of boats with their beauti
ful, slanting sails moving so slowly that they seemed not to move at n
until suddenly you found they had vanished around a bend. Before our
guests arrived we were immensely amused by a little scene enacted on
bank to which the Beduin is tied. We have a snow—white cock .wnd three
hens, a gorgeous drake and three ducks which we take hith us when me

She had been murdered by a steWard.

I talked with Prof. Sayle for some time, or rather I listened while he
talked. He told me some inside history about Gordon, which was absorb

ingly interesting, - particularly so to me as Gordon has always been 0
of my heroes. We ha d expected to move onto the dahabeah today and seﬁ
tomorrow but we've been delayed a day. Not that I care — for I've not
begun to see the wonders of this city. After church yesterday morning
