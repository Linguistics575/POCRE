Luxor and thank God for all His goodness. But my face was swollen still and Cousin Emma
protested against my going, as the church, she said, was apt to be cold. So we all spent the

morning on the boat. ’

In the afternoon Cousin Theodore, Doris and I and Jones, all in our riding clothes, were rowed
over to Luxor in the felucca, and there our own donkeys and our own saddles and our own
donkey boys were awaiting us, and off we rode to Kamak with our boys running beside us. And
along the waterfront of Luxor Cousin Theodore had an ovation. Lines of dragomans and humble
folk rose to their feet and beamingly shouted a welcome to him. As his own donkey boy said,
kissing his hand, "All the world is thankables that Mr. Davis are come back!" They say he is
known up and down the Nile as "The Friend of the Poor".

It is impossible, I think, for anyone to describe those stupendous ruins with their deathless beauty
and immortal splendor. It seized upon me almost like a sudden grief that stayed till the late
aﬁernoon chill began to tinge the air, and then ambled back on our donkeys. I adore riding a
donkey. Mine is named Sugar, and my delightful little donkey boy, with the most engaging smile,
is Malimond. Yesterday morning Doris and I attended by Malimond and Nobi (Doris's boy) rode
again to Kamak and poked about alone with a map, and felt sorry for people being conducted by
vociferating guides. On getting back to Luxor we joined the Cousins who were walking in the
Winter Palace Gardens with M. Charles Whymper, that delightful Englishman with a much too
loud voice, who writes pleasant books about birds and illustrates them with his own lovely
pictures. Whymper, the mountain climber, was his brother. In the aftemoon Cousin Theodore
and Doris went off on their donkeys across the sands toward the Lybian hills and I, with six of the
crew to row me and the ferocious second captain perched like a gigantic black bird at the stern,
and Jones as escort, went over to Luxor to visit some of the native shops. We paid a visit to
Mohammed Muhassib - the great and reliable dealer in antiquities, and because of his regard for
Cousin Theodore, I was received with pomp and graciousness by the hoary, turbaned old Arab,
and conducted into an inner treasure room where the casual purchaser never penetrates. We had
his youngest grandson, a beguiling baby in yellow satin and fez-shaped cap of white, brought in
and introduced to me. And then he gave me coffee ﬁt for the gods, and I bought a small alabaster
vase, and with many salutations I departed. I heard him telling Jones that one of his wives - "the
old one" had died. They opened the dam at Assonan yesterday - a real attention to me on my

birthday - and the Khedive and Lord Kitchener were there. I'd rather see Lord Kitchener than any
man in the world.

This morning Doris and I were rowed across and spent the best of the morning being shampooed
and manicured. The young German who shampooed me kept ejaculating "Shocking ~ shocking"
at the way my hair fell out. Just after we got back in the Beduin, a steam dahabya ﬂying many
ﬂags, the Stars and Stripes among them, came steaming down the river and people waved to us
from the deck, and we knew it was the Serapis with Emily Morgan and Miss Nelson and the rest
of the Tuck party. And as soon as we could after luncheon we rowed over and called. And it
was a joy indeed to see those two dear things. They are coming to tea tomorrow aﬁernoon,
which will make Christmas seem a little more like Christmas.

Artin Pasha has got our party somewhat confused. I've had a note from him addressed to "Mrs.

Burton" and beginning "My dear Mrs. Burton". Harry came over from the valley this aﬁemoon to

spend Christmas, and I asked him if I were his mother or if he had married me for my money. He
was terribly teased.-
