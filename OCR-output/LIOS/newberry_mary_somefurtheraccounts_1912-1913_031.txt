and is simply hideous, so that your Uncle is housebound and we play
cards and dominoes from morning till night, never stopping in the
evening until eleven P.M. The one thing that keeps me from going
crazy is that I sleep at night as though I had been clubbed.

I had a note from Mrs. Luckraft yesterday in which she said: "Isabel
will undoubtedly write me how fascinating Roger is that you and Doris
love him so."

Please take pity on your loving Mim and write to her.

Best Beloved - 'I regret to say that the pin forBob Campbell is

in my safety deposit box at the bank and that I cannot put my hand

on the key. You'll just have to tell him about it, and send it to him
later unless the enclosed permit works. It is possible the men at the
bank can open my box (it's a new one in their new vaults) without my
key. I think there are two stickpins. -The one for Bob is the greeny—

blue one, not the yellow one.

Life drags on here in clouds and rain and gloom. I love you very much

and.hope you are well and happy. Your loving
Mim.

Best Beloved — This is just to tell you how dear you were on
Sunday. Doris spoke of it, too. You made your house very happy. If
you can possibly manage to get two more tickets to the Princeton game
(for which I will pay) I can secure a young man to take Isabel and

then I can go with you. Said young man is Chilton Powell, a sort of
cousin of mine, an instructor at Columbia, and an awfully nice fellow.
He was dining here last night and I sounded him about the gamz, in case

I could get tickets, and he'll be.tickled to death to come. Please
let me know (Gambier) as soon as you can, what the prospects are so
that I can let him know officially.

Best love, darling, from
' Your Mim.

Best Beloved — Yesterday in Cleveland Mr. and Mrs. Eells spent
an hour trying to make me say that I would go to Egypt with them. I
finally agreed to let them know as soon as I could hear-from you. I

did not tell them that I would go if you Were willing; but I did say
that it was matters in connection with you that stood in the Way of
my accepting their invitation. If you are willing I would like to go.

 

If you are not willing I do not want to go. The reason why I do not
