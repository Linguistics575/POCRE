. Dear Cousin T. remarks at intervals what a fine fellow you are, and
painstakingly explains again and again how it happened that he did not
recognize you. He is perfectly devoted to Doris and I am tickled almost
to death. He said the other day that with us two in Egypt he knew he'd
have a charming time. "I've sometimes had such dreadful people", he
added:

I do so hope you can find time to go to see Kimmy. Please do if you
possibly can, Dearest. I'm so afraid the memory of his family may grow
dim if he doesn't see any of us for six months, and I really could not
bear that.

Did Doris tell you of our wonderful presents from Mrs. Eells? For D.

a check for 250 francs to buy something for herself; and for me a
beautiful wooden box with lock and key, filled with the most delightful
toilet articles, exquisite soaps, colognes, bath salts etc. etc.

Well,.Beloved, goodbye for this time. I'm wondering when my postal from
Gibraltar will reach you. My love to Jack and Wilson Foss. Endless,
endless love to you and every blessing on your dear head.

Your very own

Darling Gopher — I The day we got to Naples was simply heavenly.

I posted you a letter from there the minute I reached the Hotel. Also

I posted 23 other letters and notes that I'd written on the steamer.

As we were driving from the steamer to our h05telry, the Grand Hotel,
Doris and I grinning With delight over everything we saw, our carriage
was held up by what at first seemed to be two leaping, shouting brigands
who turned out to be Harry Burton and Jim Whittaker. I think I told you
on my post card from Naples that Jim came all the way from Florence to
meet us. And Giulio Tedeschi sent word that he would have given his sou
to come also, but couldn't leave his sick mother. We had a perfect time
that first day — it was so beautiful, and I'm wondering why I hated
Naples so that long ago time when I was a girl.

After we had seen our quarters at the hotel, we all, except Connie -.,
went driving along a wonderful mountain road above the city to Posolippo,
with ecstatic views. In the afternoon while naps were being taken by

the Elders, Jim and Doris and I went to the Aquarium, stopping on our Way
by the seaWall to see a lot of fishermen drawing in a seine. They did

~it with a rythmic stamping of the feet and wild shouts and as much en—
thusiasm as though they did not do it twice every day of their lives.

The Aquarium is wonderful — such extraordinary denizens of the deep,

and all from the Mediterranean. Later in the afternoon we all went

to Bert011nl'5 for tea. First you drive zigzagging up and up a mountain-
