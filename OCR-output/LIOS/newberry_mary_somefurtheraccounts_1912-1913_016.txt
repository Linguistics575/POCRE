Luxor - 1“ February, 1913

Darling Gopher — You are my best and only Valentine, and I Wish
you were here or I were there to tell you so, viva voce. I have not}
interesting to record this time of my personal doings because my Whol
week has been given up to ﬁomesickness and rheumatism. I have suffej
torments with sciatica or neuritis or some kindred diabolical diseasg
in my left leg: and I‘ve not been off the boat since going to church
last Sunday morning. To make matters worse the sun — the brilliant,i
constant, revivifying Egyptian sun — has withdrawn its light for two
Whole days, and it actually rained all day yesterday, resulting in t}
damp and cold and g100m on which rheumatism thrives. But I'm glad if
not Doris who is stricken down be her old enemy. If she had to bear“
in addition to her daily task of Bridge I think she'd go crazy.

Day before yesterday When she came back from a morning across the ri\
at Luxor she announced that Ex—President Diaz with a party of "grensl
looking Mexicans" was tied up over there in a gorgeous dnhnbya. He

must be glad he is here instead of in his War—tossed native land. '
Mr. J. P. Morgan is also tied up over there on his boat, and rumor h:
it that the Great Man is as cross as two sticks (he may be having a

left leg, also) and making the lives of his guestsﬁa burden to them.

We expect to leave here March lst for Aswan, and I presume we shall
find ourselves in Cairo again about March 15th. Mr. Rudyard Kipling
there now. I hope my next communication to you will contain more th

The love I send you is endless
Your Mim.

Best Beloved — Your letter of Jan. 29 came on Wednesday_ Jus
three weeks after you wrote it. I certainly am very far aWay, and I
sometimes get frightfully homesick for you. I am still more or less
crippled from rheumatism, and it will be two weeks tomorrow since I!
pleasure of riding my donkey. It makes me chafe to think of how mud
I might have seen in that time, and now our days here are numbered:
as we start for Aswan a week from tomorrow. I do hope the Romeyns w
Will get here before then, — or we may see them farther up the riveﬁ
Last Monday I left the boat for the first time in eight days and thﬂ
only to go across the river to see if electricity would do my achinﬁ
leg any good. Tuesday I went again for the same purpose and on my ?
found Newton Byers sitting on deck talking to the Sister—Kitty! I %
much more glad to see him than I've ever been before, and Wednesdaya
afternoon I went over to the steamer aneses III and called on his
mother and sister. His mother is just a nice, plain mother, but hif
sister struck me as something quite lovely and fine and rare, Whicb
opinion is cordially seconded by the carping and critical D. NeW?erT
