her come down one crane. -I myself counted sixty—tw0 pelicans sitting on
a sandbar. And today we sailed by close to Kasz-es—Sayad ("the Hunter's
Castle"), and what easily might be a castle is nothing more nor less
that a colossal pigeon-house. Hundreds of thousands of pigeons were
perching on the battlements or flying about them, and little flocks

here hastening home to them from all directions. They are bred in this
land as much for their droppings, which make a much—prized fertilizer,
as for food. (That's a horrid sounding sentence but you Will understand
What I mean). On the West bank of the river, opposite the Hunter's
Castle, is the little town of Hou where for 53 years Shieck Selim sat
stark naked on the bank of the Nile. He died a few years ago, and they
built a tomb on his sitting place to which the natives make pilgrimages.
Clothes seem rather lightly esteemed in Egypt. If the day is Warm the
Shaduf workers wear practically the same garb as the Apache Indian, and
their beautiful bodies look like bronze. We were passing quite close to
the shore when a gentleman bounded down the banks, yanked off his one and
only garment and proceeded to do is laundry work in the Nile.

Sunday — 22nd December. The Beduin, Luxor. At noon yesterday -
and a day soaked in sunshine — we came in sight of Luxor, and a short
time thereafter had reached its outskirts, and from the Window of a
dahabya tied to the east bank the pleasant, tousled head of Nicole, an
English artist, bowed and called greetings to Cousin Theodore. Past
some charming looking hotels we slipped, catching glimpses in between
of the most beautiful columns of the Temple of Luxor, past the Winter
Palace Hotel, and then diagonally across the rive to our mooring place
on the west shore. We have it all to ourselves at present, the other
boats preferring to be in the thick of everythin on the east bank. But
we have a beautiful sandy beach on which the crew have pitched their
tent, and where we instantly established the poultry yard. The three
coops were taken from the dahabya put on the sand and openede Sir
Francis Drake and his three ladies Waddled madly for the bank, slid down
it on their tails and launched themselves joyously upon the Water. The
White Cock stepped daintily forth, lonely but still gallant. Alllis
wives were eaten on the way up. But seldom are widowers so soon con—
soled - by 9 a.m. today he had three more. The turkey cock and his
consort emerged from their coop so stiff they could hanﬂy stand up.

But they were soon limbered, and-the gobbler strutted and rustled and

gobbled as though he owned the earth.

But Oh my dear! if you could see what lies beyond our beach! A great
plain with stretches of sand and stretches of lovely green, and clumps

of trees, and then the fierce and glaring and beautiful Lybinn mountains
making a mighty wall beyond. I cannot give you any idea of how Wonder-
ful it is. I could have spent the whole afternoon looking, but I sudden-
ly went Wild with neuralgia in my face and took to my bed and suffered
torments for hours, and then — as suddenly - the pain left and I slept
all night, and got up this morning ready for anything. I wanted to go

to church this a.m. but Cousin Emma objected as my face was still swollen
and she said the church was always cold.

This afternoon when Cousin Theodore had had his nap, he, Doris, I and
Jones, all in our riding clothes, were rowed across the river in the
felucca- Our donkeys were awaiting us in front of the Winter Palace,
the donkey boys (old retainers) kissed our hands and off we started
for Karnak. We could only take a most cursory look at thos stupendous

ruins - actually inconceivable until you stand in their"presence.
