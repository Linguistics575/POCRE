the coast of Amalfi. Monday we shall probably proceed upon our

way to Florence. Before leaving Cairo We managed to work in a little
mOre sightseeing. We saw a mosque - the second largest in the world,
and quite beautiful. It contains tWO objects of particular interest —
a granite column that came there all by itself from Mecca, and a magic
stone which when people have violent tummy aches they go and lick
until their tongues bleed. Quite a deep hollow had been licked in

it, and the blood stains on the base were very revolting. We also
went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which form a sort of Stately City

of the Dead with superb domes and exquisite minarets, on the outskirts
of the City proper and close to the desert. Doris and I would have -
given our eyeteeth for one untrammeled week in Cairo. There are such
Wonderful things to see and do there and we missed so many of them
through no fault of ours.

I do so hope to find a letter from you in Naples forwarded from Paris.
It seems very long since I heard.
Your loving, loving Mim.

Best Beloved — We are feeling so terribly over the news

of Charlie Walcott's death which We just heard yesterday. I have

that most desperate of all feelings — the belief that somehow it might
have been prevented. This is no reflection on his father, who could
not drop everything and go with him to California. But if he had had
a mother or his sister to go with him we would not have been subjected
for so long to what Mr. Walcott himself wrote me was "the wrong

treatment." The one ray of comfort in the whole tragedy is that he is
now with his mother.

I got your letter of Zarch 20th the other day in Naples, just after I
had posted mine to you. And your April lst one reached me here yester—

day. We had to waste one day in Naples as it rained so torrentialiy,
and practically the sole fru1t of our stay there was that Doris saw
Pompeii — which was one of her heart's desires.- I would have liked

to see it too, for in the 30 years which have elapsed since I was there
much has been excavated. But it Wasn't possible for us both to do it,
and I Was crazy to have D. go. We got here Tuesday night, having
left Naples at 9:U5 that morning, with Vesuvius covered a third of

‘the way dOWn from its summit with snow. The cold and the rain here

in Italy have been hard to bear after the sunlight and warmth of Egypt.
But it is such an entrancing trip here from Naples — such verdant count
such beautiful vinyards, such a riot of flowers, the mountains and
hills so splended and so romantic with the feudal towns crowning the
summits of the foothills and long, long roads leading up to them. On

the enclosed card I've marked about where our sitting room windows
are, and the bridge you see is the far famed Ponte Vecchio, lined on

both sides with the most enthralling shops. Near the bridge this side
of the Ponte Vecchio, and Which just misses getting into the picture,

someone was committing suicide as we drove up to the hotel the night
of our arrival.
