Luxor. We brought Miss Buchanan home to luncheon. She it is who built up the Mission School
(the American Mission) at Luxor, and who is head now of the larger one in Cairo, and whom
Cousin Theodore admires so profoundly. Everyone does, I think. A little, very plain little
woman, whose "outward semblance doth belie her soul's immensity". The beauty of that soul
makes itself apparent to all kinds of people. A Sheik from the desert who came to one of the
Commencements at the Mission School here said to one of the teachers, in speaking of Miss
Buchanan, "Today for the ﬁrst time in my life have I seen a Woman! How can I go back to those
three — my wives!"

This aﬁemoon the Fahnestocks came to tea and some English people named Rae puffed over in a
steam Launch ﬁ‘om Luxor, bringing Mohammed Mohassib. The old man enjoyed himself
enormously, sat in various chairs, chuckling at everything, insisted on drinking tea, because it was
the custom at this hour on this boat, though he disliked it greatly, and we were all telling him to
wait a few minutes and he should have some coffee. We were disappointed because he wasn't
cladin rich raiment — he being a millionaire - but he was bundled up in a brown and white checked
shawl around his neck and an old brown overcoat with a hood to it, such as our sailors wear at
night.

Monday, Februam 3. A heavenly day - like all the others that have gone before it. The wind
ceased suddenly last night before it had torn us from our moorings, and this morning dawned as
quietly as possible. Doris went over to Kamak for the forenoon with Margaret Fahnestock, and
in the afternoon she rode out to the diggings with Cousin Theodore, while I spent the aﬁemoon in
the novel and thrilling occupation of falling in love with a Russian Princess. The Contessa had
invited me to go to Kamak in a small party of which the Princess was one. We were to be shown
about by M. Legrain himself (he has for years been conducting the excavations at Kamak). But
that part fell throngh and it was Mme. Legrain who took us about, Legrain himself being absorbed
with a dissipated looking Prince de Croix. But little I cared as long as I could gaze upon my

Princess. Besides, I think we saw pretty much what we would have seen under Legrain's
guidance.

We watched the workmen carefully unearthing a large and beautiful jar from a ruined and
crumbling wall beyond the sacred lake. We held our breaths while it was being emptied, and let
them out again when nothing but a brick was found inside. We went to the little temple of Ptah in
one dusky room of which stands the uncanny black granite statue of Sekmet, the goddess with the
lion's head. When you have looked at her for ﬁve minutes she becomes so vibrant with life that it
is easy to understand why the Arabs believe that she sometimes prowls forth seeking whom she
may devour. My chief pleasure this aftemoon was watching the Princess - a fairy Princess, young,
little, beautiful, quiet, with a delightﬁil laugh and a perfect simplicity of manner. She looks like a
high bred Englishwoman except that her eyes are somehow different. Her skin is healthily tanned
with a lively color in it. She wore a most perfect pongee skirt, just off the white in tone, shoes to
match, a short. silk sweater coat of tawny orange, a hat like all our hats (bought in Cairo for $1.00)
with a long veil, like all our veils only of a lighter shade than her sweater, a cane with a
bloodstone sunk in the top of the handle, and a monocle on a black ribbon. She walked so well
on her little feet and when she took off her gloves later at tea in the garden of the Luxor Hotel,
her hands were covered with superb sapphires. Doris had seen her on the street in the morning,
was insantly antagonized by the monocle, and came home saying she was "a sight" and that her
donkey had shied at her. So much for the intolerance of youth. She is the Princess Gortschokoff
and she has me bound to her chariot wheels.
