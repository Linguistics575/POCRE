into the immaculate felucca, and skimmed down the starlit river, with six white turbans bowing
rythmically before us as the men bent to their oars. Two of them, carrying lanterns, escorted us
from the landing to the hotel entrance and we found them standing like statues awaiting us when
we re-emerged in the middle of the night. We had a lovely time. Doris was much entertained by
amusing young Englishmen, some of whom danced well, and I enjoyed myself enormously talking
to some people and watching others. The Contessa was there looking as ghastly as a clown at a
circus. "They say" that last year she had yellow hair and a red face. This year she is in mourning
for her divorced husband (who was, very properly, shot a short time ago) so now her hair is black
and her face whitewashed. A young Englishman, who evidently hates her, told Doris that she was
the deplorable kind of elderly female who loves to have a phalanx of boys about her. As I'm that
kind myself I'm beginning to think I may like her when I really know her. She has invited me to
ride with her some time.

This afternoon Doris and I rode to our beloved Kamak. All Luxor watched our start and small
wonder, for there were nine men - six of the crew, two donkey boys and Jones trying to saddle
Sugar to suit me. This sounds as though I were getting ﬁissy but I'm not. It's only that Sugar has
such a small tummy that it seems impossible to cinch a side saddle to him securely, and it's misery
to ride on a turned saddle. Later Cousin Emma and I teaed on the Aziz with the Von Bissings,
whose table fairly tottered under the weight of things to eat.

Thursday, J anuam 9. A perfectly delicious day - it really has seemed to me the best air we've had
yet. Doris and I had a heavenly time this morning. We rode out to the Ramesseum starting early
and taking only Nobi and Malimond with us. It was lovely there - in a way I liked it better than
any of the ruins we've seen - there were no tourists, no excavating going on - just silence and
remoteness and sunshine and the mighty 'past. Mr. Nicoll came over this afternoon late to say
goodbye. He starts back to England tomorrow. We hear Lord Kitchener was in Luxor this
aftemoon. So near and I didn't see him! I have said — and believed I meant it - that there wasn't a
man in the world who could make me marry him, but if Lord Kitchener proposes to me I shall
undoubtedly accept him.

Friday, Januag 10. An exciting note from Harry this morning before breakfast saying that he has
unearthed a red granite sarcophagus, that the lid has fallen off, top downward, but evidently has a
recumbent ﬁgure carved upon it, and that it will take him about two days to remove the debris in
which it is embedded. Cousin Theodore has lost all interest in the tomb of Siphtah, for some
incomprehensible reason, and when he came in to breakfast and I said "Isn‘t it thrilling about the
sarcophagus?" he merely said "Ha!" But later he announced that he thought he'd ride over to the
valley tomorrow and take Doris with him - adding that he didn't think that the discovery of the
sarcophagus would prove to be of the least importance. Doris went to ride by herself this
afternoon, with a nautical escort, on the other side of the river and I took a walk with Cousin
Theodore on the sands. In one place where there were some damp hollows about 40 or 50
wagtails were apparently playing a game. It was charming to watch. They would jump into the
air and land lightly again with a little ﬂutter of wings, run a few steps and then jump into the air.
It was actually a gray aﬁernoon with a heavy and depressing atmosphere. The Von Bissings
lunched with us. The Baron's descriptions of things are unique. He was telling about a tree he
had seen in the morning that was "entirely ill and losing all its sings"! The Baroness says their
little girl (at home in Munich) always prefers to speak English "because" the child says "to speak
German makes me so hot! " I think that's a perfect description of the effect on one of a difﬁcult
tongue.

Goodbye for this time, my dears all

Your devoted Mary
