Harry Burton and I went to see the Blue Mosque, -a beautiful, half ruinec
structure, parts of whose walls are covered with superb Persian tiles

in blue and white. Hundreds of young men and boys were sitting about in
groups on the floor reciting the Koran aloud. The weather is heavenly
We wear our winter clothes and Cousin TheodOre declares it cold but I.
am basking in warmth, except in the evening. ,

_Give my dear love to Mr. and Mrs. Bells and the young people. The
Sister—Kittie is in high favor and I am very happy.

A Happy, Happy New Year to you my darling.
Your loving

Darling Gopher - This is the best paper and I shall not use it
often in writing to you, but am giviﬁg you a treat as long as this is my
first letter to you from the boat. I'd give anything if you were here.
It is impossible to convey by written description any adequate idea of t
incomparable river and the scenes through which it winds. And how it
winds! We almost ... the compass in our meandering. And it would take
a whole day's Writing, and result in a letter you Would carry about with
you - possibly - but never read, if I tried to describe the variety of
scenery. The principal towns are on the west shore, and it is on that
shore that the railroad from Cairo to Luxor runs, and there is enough of
ceaseless interest on that side to hold you spellbound fiom the cool
early morning through the glowing day tothe moonlit dusk. But it's no—
thing to the Eastern Shore with its desert stretches, its cultivated str
and terraces, its palm groves, its native villages so absolutely fasci—
nating that each one fills me With delight, some of them are walled abou
and those alWays have towering palms growing within the walls; the
unwalled ones are sometimes hard to distinguish from the desert sand out
of Which they rise a.d the desert hills into which they melt without
one speck of anything green about them. And always on that magic
astern Shore the fierce Arabian hills which follow us all the way to
Luxor, semetimes far in the distance, sometimes in the foreground. Ab—
solutely bleak and bare, of the strangest shapes, long stretches of them
where surely no human foot has ever been, then long stretches where they
have been quarried for buﬂding stone, or tunnelled for tombs. Yesterday
'morning we sailed close to the foot of gigantic limestone cliffs that
rose precipitously out of the river, where men in white robes clinging t
ledges were prying off great blocks of rock that came rolling and crashi
to the water's edge to be loaded on barges. The sunlight on this scene
made a blinding glare. Ang the people — the picturesque people - no X
stretch so barren but that you can alWays see those stately shrouded
figures, working in the fields, at the Shadufs, fishing, sitting motion-
less brooding by the river, praying with their faces to the East, women
filling their water jars and striding up the bank with the full jars

on their heads, disdaining to touch them even with one hand, people

goin and coming along the road — on foot 0n donke*s on camels alwav‘
camels and donkeys everywhere), flocks feeding by the’shore shephérded-h

by one Or two cloaked and hooded figures. And on the river itself greai
barges loaded With cotton, with grain, with water jars packed so that
they look like cream colored cannon balls, - or merely boats filled wit}
