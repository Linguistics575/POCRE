lost himself so as not to be a drag upon the rest. I feel almost

as sorry for the unhappy fellow whOSe skate struck Crosson as I do

for him. It Would be so hideous to carry through life the memory of havir
done a thing like that even if it was utterly unavoidable. I hope you
Won't forget to tell me in your next how he is coming on.

I shall have to give your love to Wadi Halfn, Sugar's successor. I've
never set eyes on Sugar since the day long ago when I got off him
bouncing and braying on an embankment and vowed I'd not ride him again.

Good night, my Darling. I do get so terribly homesick for you some-

times that I'd give all the pomp and circumstance of Egypt to be back
at 615 Orange St.

God bless you and keep you safe.
Your loving

Oh Gopher, I donlt know what I would not have given to have had you here
today to go With us on our expedition to the Great Dam. It surely must
be one of the Wonders of the World - and what a feat of engineering!

We left Luxor Saturday the lst and got here yesterday the 4th — 133 miles
Baedeker says. Awfully slow going, — but then we stopped twice, the first
time at Edfu that Doris and I might see the temple there; and the second
time at Kom Ombb: for us to inspect that temple, and also because the Wind
Was blowing so terrifically that navigation Was excessively unpleasant, —
so We tied up there at about one on Monday and didn't start again until
early the next (yesterday) morning. Although we were within two minutes
Walk of_the temple D. and I did not stir off the boat until five o'clock
When the wind died down. That Kom Cm bo temple is an extraordinary one
because it is duplex — one side being dedicated to a good god — the elder
Horus, and the other to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk. I prefer
the later name because it sounds like a crocodile, if said down in your
throat with full value given to all the consonants. There is one room in
a little chapel on Sobk's side which is full ofmummied crocodiles - quite
.the horridest things I've seen in a~longiwhile.' The temple is in a most
ruinous condition, but, perhaps, all the more beautiful for that, and the
situation and views are superb. D. and I climbed up on the wreck 6f a
splendid pylon and sat there watching the sunset and indulging in a
pleasant melancholy, and had it all to ourselves,,except for the faith-
ful escort, Haneen and a sailor, who dogged our feetsteps. It really is
awfully good of the Cousins to bring us up here ~ for they are tired to
death of it, having seen it so many times, and they don't go anywhere or
do anything except stay on the boat and arrange for us to see the sights.
Yesterday morning shortly after we left Kom Ombo we found a mile of
flamingoes standing in ranks and files on the sandbars!

We arrived here about 12:30-yesterday and it was a joyful crew that tied
us up, for most of them live here. Doris and I did the bazaar yesterday
afternoon with Haneen to drive bargains for us and Amelie and a sailor
in our train. You understand that "the bazaar" in these towns means a

long narrow street, or streets, with the roofs nearly meeting overhead
and tiny shallow little shops like pigeonholes all along on both sides.
We thought the bazaar in Cairo enthralling, but it falls short of this

one though it's much larger. This one so reeks of the desert and the
strange things that come out of it. You would have gone wild over the
