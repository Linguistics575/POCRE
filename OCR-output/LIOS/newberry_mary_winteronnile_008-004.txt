absorbingly interesting talk with Mr. Sayce, who told me some inside history about Gordon, who
has always been one of my heroes.

This af‘temoon Harry Burton and I dashed out in the motorcar to see the obelisk. He couldn't tell
me what obelisk and the guidebook had been sent to the Beduin. But it was worth going to see,
and in the neighborhood was an estate enclosed in one of those high mud walls that fascinate me
so, and between the obelisk and the wall a ﬂock of goats were feeding, shepherded by three
shrouded ﬁgures - quite perfect as a picture.

Harry starts for Luxor tonight by train. There isn't a room for him on the dahabeah, worse luck -
he's one of the most amusing persons I've ever known.

We board the Beduin tomorrow some time. It’s all enchanting whether we go or stay.

Goodbye, dears all, for this time.
Devotedly,
Mary

Dahabya Beduin

Egypt
Dearest Adeline:-

Our ﬁrst night on the dahabeah (it really doesn't matter much how you spell it - though I doubt
not that the way at the top of this is really the most knowing). We spent the morning in
preparations to move from the hotel, paying bills, etc., and dashing across the street for ﬁnal
purchases at little shops. Also Cousin Theodore elected to make it Christmas for Doris and me,
bestowing upon Doris a pearl and diamond ring and upon me a gold mesh bag - much too elegant
for 615 Orange Street, but which really suits me to a T! At about 2:30, after tipping whole tribes
of Arabs and other more commonplace nations of the earth, we four entered the bright red motor
car and scooted Nile—wards, followed by Jones and Amelie in another vehicle, the tops of their
heads just visible above the masses of hand luggage packed around them. Although we had
visited the Beduin daily it was with quite a different sensation that we stepped down our ﬂowery
bank (we have quite a garden) and really took possession. Then we all set to work putting
innumerable belongings into what seemed absolutely inadequate spaces for them. But we ﬁnally
evolved perfect order, the unpacked trunks were sent back to Cook's and the whole place looks
like the Abode of Peace - a very luxurious Peace, I grant you! On answering a twice repeated
summons to tea on the upper deck, I found a foreign gentleman of - to me - most unpleasant
personality, who on being introduced to me, rose, brought his heels together, swept off is hat and
bowed from the waist. Having had my tea and not being fascinated with the Russian, I sauntered
off. I was told afterwards that he is a ﬁrst cousin to the Czar, is fabulously rich, has an Egyptian
museum of his own in Moscow, and for a long time was in the habit of bringing with him to the .
Nile a new wife each year. Whether at the end of each winter he fed the lady to the crocodiles, or
reserved her for Siberia, history does not record.

There is about a ton of brown bread cut in slices spread out to dry on the deck at the stern. It's
for the crew. They like it that way. The birds hop joyously all over it, and a cat or two pay
thieving visits to it. The crew and inside servants are twenty in number and are so silent it is hard
to believe there is one on board. They wear blue sweaters with BEDUIN in red letters across the

8heartiest welcome, my fondest thoughts to you both, wishing had been able to come down with

Jim. Am with you in my heart. Sending love to all." He told Jim Whittaker that he "would have
given his soul" to come to Naples to meet us, but his mother was ill and he couldn‘t.
Now I must send this and write to someone else.

Faithful love,
Mary

December 9 1912.
Shepheard's Hotel
Cairo

 

Dearest Adeline — I've seen the Sphinx. In hot sunlight, with a sky of a blue to make one gasp,
with the desert wind in our faces and desert sand sitting into our shoes, with an atmosphere of
molten pearls in the distance, with here and there a white-robed Arab, a stately camel, a white
donkey with gay trappings, with the pyramids towering in the background - we saw her. No
description I have ever read, no picture I have ever seen had prepared me. I'd like to sit and look
at her for days. The pyramids are tremendously impressive to think about, but it did not thrill me
to see them; and I cannot describe the feeling that surged through me when I faced the Sphinx.
Doris and I wanted to climb the Great Pyramid but Cousin Theodore absolutely reﬁised to have
us boosted by Arabs so we had to give it up. The Sphinx has been our great experience since my
last letter.

For the rest, the Arabian nights continues. We are wakened in the morning by the cry of the kites
wheeling above the garden. When I ﬂing open my blinds and look into said garden with its
towering palms, its wonderful plants, its vivid lawns, I see a crane stepping "high, wide and
handsome" along the bright red paths. This morning as I was standing on the terrace in front of
the hotel a man went by on the sidewalk with a goat trotting along on one side of him and a
monkey on the other. The white-robed, red-sashed, befezzed individual who salaams as he opens
the dining room door for us, wears a silver ring inserted coyly in the top of his right ear.
Gorgeous creatures, glittering with gold embroidery, seated at intervals in the halls, rise and
salaam as we pass. But the thing that, even aﬁer a week here, strikes me as being a masquerade
and not real life is the women on the sidewalks or in beautifully appointed carriages who look
mysteriously at you with dark eyes gleaming above the white veil that hides the rest of their faces.
The woman on the sidewalk for the most part wears the black veil, but she in the victoria or
brougham wears the white.

Yesterday after church at All Saints where Mr. Sayce preached an excellent sermon on "Thy
Kingdom Come", Harry Burton and I drove to the Blue Mosque, crumbling but very beautiful and
with several interior walls covered with superb Persian tiles, any one of which I should consider a
treasure. Hundreds of youths and boys were seated in groups on the ground reciting the Koran at
the top of their lungs. In the aﬁemoon we had a little tea on the dahabeah (its name is the
Beduin) and, while awaiting our guests, were inﬁnitely amused watching the antics of our white
cock and gorgeous drake each trying to assert supremacy over a certain spot on the bank. The
drake was victorious and then proceeded to make himself look exactly like Napoleon.

Our guests were Mr. Sayce, Artin Pasha, and an Egyptian gentleman Claudius Bey, whose hair
turned snow white a few years ago when he went to meet his wife on an incoming steamer at
Alexandria and found her murdered in her cabin. His two little girls, aged seven and ﬁve, are

, living in England with their Grandmother, and he said he fancied he would have to go live in
England too, as they absolutely refused to come back to Egypt — seven and ﬁve! I had an

7grey aﬁemoon (we've not yet seen the sun in Cairo). And perhaps it was the absence of the ﬁerce
blue background that disappointed me at ﬁrst. But when we had teaed at the Mena House and
started home along that wonderful road with its endless procession of startling ﬁgures of men and
beasts and veiled women (I had an uncanny feeling that we were driving through the Old
Testament in a motor car) - we had only to turn our heads a little to see those strange and
splendid monuments against the blood red sky of the sunset.

Wednesday, December 4. Another grey day, but it doesn't matter in the least. Why should it, in a
land where everything is a thousand times more enchanting even than you expected it to be? I
had to stay in the hotel this morning doing dull but necessary things while the others went off and
amused themselves. But this afternoon we motored out through that extraordinary new suburb
Heliopolis, the perpetration of a German Syndicate drunk with power - and out into the desert
until it was easy to believe that there was nothing in all the world but wide wastes and ridges and
deep hollows of grey and shifting sands. We stopped on our homeward way for tea at the
Heliopolis Palace Hotel, and watched people of various nationalities from those who spoke an
unknown tongue to nice Englishmen with darling dogs. The cousins have seen all the wonders of
this land for so many years that they "cannot", as Doris told Artin Pasha this aﬁemoon - "cannot
understand why we are so wild with excitement whenever we see a camel." (Indeed Doris riding
a camel in Cairo would be much less conspicuous that she is on a horse in New Haven.) Artin
Pasha, an Armenian archaeologist of distinction, and Prof. Sayce, Oxford Don, scientist of great
renown, called this aﬁernoon and talked delightﬁilly. Artin Pasha wore his fez all the time, and I
have to confess looked the "unspeakable Turk", blear-eyed and with a rather dreadﬁil nose, and

the Oxford Don wore a collar of prehistoric vintage, light brown socks and chopped-off Congress
gaiters of black.

Thursday, December 5. Today Cairo has basked in sunlight, but it's been a "white day", the sky
lacking the deep Egyptian blue and the air somewhat hazy. We went to the Zoo, which was
enchanting, visited the Beduin - our dahabeah - and I wish everybody I know and care for could
see it. It's a beauty. Jones and Amelie, and the crew and native servants (20 in nUmber) were all
engaged in getting things spick and span. A small ﬂock of ducks came paddling frantically up
when whistled for and gobbled the bread I threw them. We are to move on board Monday and
start early Tuesday morning. This aﬁemoon we went to the Citadel and entered that wonderful
mosque of Mohammed Ali, the minarets of which are so ethereal, so exquisite, you almost fear
they will vanish as you watch them. We did not have to put off our shoes from off our feet, but
we had to slip huge yellow slippers over them.

Things go on being as deliciously strange as ever; a man sits on a bench in the Zoo and is shaved
by an itinerant barber; a tall athletic ﬁgure clad in a heavenly blue garment strides across the street
with three dried crocodiles under his arm, and no one but 615 Orange Street even turns to look at
him. Every time we'emerge upon the terrace of Shepheard's, fakirs with monkeys, cobras and
mongooses meet our enraptured gaze, and the riot of color satisﬁes even my color loving soul.
The notice in one's bedroom --

Ring once for the Waiter
Ring twice for the Maid
Ring three times for the Arab

tempts you to ring three times every ﬁfteen minutes. And, by the way I forgot to copy, in my
letter about Naples, a telegram I received there from Giulio Tedeschi, the young Italian whom we
knew in England and who lives in Livomo. It was so deliciously un-American; this was it: "My

6we landed there yesterday - it was so more than beautiful as we drew near it on - '

like rmles of ivory palaces ﬂoating on liquid lapis. As we sailed through the narrtdlfv se‘iiatraiidgiiictzd
the ﬁne harbor With _sh1pping from many and far distant lands all about us, and lovely square-
ngged sailing craft ndmg at anchor, and the Khedive's palace facing us, and beautiﬁil masses of
color on the wharf where men in fezes and turkish trousers and gold embroidery, men in turbans
and long straight robes of dark blue, pale blue, light yellow, orange, dull brown, soft green, white
black, moved and gesticulated and shouted - the voice of one of our compatriots said, pettishly ,
near us - Oh, this harbor is so glu_ll." I wonder why the gods permit people with scales upon their
eyes to travel. Through a scene of mad and wholly enchanting conﬁJsion we tore to the railroad
station in bumpy little carriages with drivers who shouted enthusiastically every step of the way.
Arrived, we took possession of two comfortable compartments reserved in loud red letters for
:‘Davrs Pasha", while Jones and Amelie did the work. They both speak Arabic, and Jones,
imperative but courteous, and Amelie, moving about like a battering-ram and hissing out vicious
syllables, accomplished the impossible. We were very late in getting oﬂ‘, but the glories of the
evening still make shivers run up and down my spine. Burning red spread half around the
horizon. On the right of us feathery pampas grass spread out in vast ﬁelds of the Cloth of Gold
edging a lake pale blue like Montana sapphires, and a ﬂight of ducks were silhouetted in black
against it. To the left of us cream colored walls with palm trees towering above them, tiny
villages of mud hovels, a ﬂeet of sails among the ﬁelds where an invisible canal was ﬂowing, tall
ﬁgures robed in white standing motionless to watch the train, the Flight into Egypt repeated again
and again on the high road, and towering over all the purple twilight (at last I've seen a purple
twilight) with Venus glittering on its edge.

We had expected to reach Cairo in time for dinner, but as it was we dined upon the train, and
Doris and I were glad, for never before had we had a meal where Persian powder was dashed in
splotches on the window panes to keep the ﬂeas outside. We were waited upon with cyclonic
ardor by two natives in snowy robes, red sashes and fezes. (There must be some other plural for
that, but I don't know it.) At the station in Cairo three or four of Cousin Theodore‘s native
servants were waiting to welcome us with kissing of hands and those touchings of the forehead
and the breast that somehow look so theatrical. At the hotel the manager met us at the. door and
conducted us at once to a gorgeous suite of rooms, while all our traveling companions were
waiting and writhing at the desk. All these ostentatious details I give you because it amuses me
clear through to my backbone that we, the denizens of that tiny apartment in Orange Street the
Despised, should be careering about the earth in Pomp and Circumstance.

This morning while standing on the terrace of Shepheard's waiting for our bright red motor car,
Doris and I were fallen upon by two old Colorado friends. Then we, escorted by Cousin
Theodore and Harry Burton, went to the Museum where we had one of the sensations of our lives
inspecting the wonders and the beauties of the Theodore M. Davis Room. Also we were taken
into the Holy of Holies and presented to Sir Gaston Maspero, who was most channing. He 15 fat
and chuckly and of a great simplicity and sweetness, and wholly delightﬁil. And he gave us each
(Doris and me) a grey and gold permit "de visiter jusqu' du 30 Juin, 1913, tous les monuments
fermes en enclos de la Haute—Egypte“ - besides, of course, the freedom of the Museum.

After luncheon, while the Elders were napping, Harry and Doris and I escaped and did the bazaars
on foot and saw more queer things in an hour than in most of our lives put together before. "The
crowded streets of the bazaar" - every chronicler says that, but henceforth it will call up to my
mental vision a vivid picture instead of the vague impression of old. We were a little frowned on
when we returned, and it was suggested that we were probably packed with ﬂeas or worse; but
we were given the beneﬁt of the doubt and were then swept off to see the Pyramids. It was a

5tired she was beginning to hate everything. We all thought it was worth journeying to Naples
simply to see that bronze "Hermes Resting", found at Herculaneum.

Yesterday, another very beautiful day, we sailed, oﬂicially at noon but really not till two. The .
delay was caused by a tragedy. A poor sailor or stevedore was killed when some cargo was being
lowered into the hold, and we had to wait until the city authorities would let us go. Doris and
Harry Burton and I stood long on deck as we moved out of that superb harbor, and when we had
sailed past Capri all the perfect beauty of the unparalleled coast unrolled before us, its_many Cities
and hamlets lying white in the shadow and pink in the sunlight. We were almost certain we could
pick out the spot where

"Sits Amalﬁ in the heat

Bathing ever her white feet W

In the tideless summer seas." '
If My we can take that drive when we come back!

We passed Stromboli near midnight, but it was sleeping so there was nothing to see but a huge
black cone rising out of the sea. And m were sleeping when we threaded the Straits of Messma.

We are very comfortable on this steamer, though not as luxurious as on the Berlin. All these
German boats feed you to death. You could stuﬂ‘ till you burst if you were so "dispoged". There
is everything on the menus to which the plain American has been accustomed from infancy
(including "corned beef hache Americaine") as well as everything you never heard of from
"Spitcake" to "Lobskaus with dilled cucumber".

Sunday, December 1.

And a mighty indolence is upon me, body and mind. My spectacles are broken and I can't see to
read Baedecker's Egypt, and rejoice that I can't.

There was a sunset last night that steeped our very souls in color. It ﬁlled the heavens, glittering
gold in the west and mother-of-pearl in the east, while liquid opal shifted and vanished on the sea.
Today it has been a calm sea and delicious warmth and a far dim glimpse of Crete. Tomorrow it
ought to be Alexandria about noon and Cairo in time for dinner. And I hope that when we reach

Cairo Doris and I will be able to remember that we are puﬂick ladies and keep from shrieking
with delight.

The moment we reached the hotel at Naples I posted 24 letters and notes I had written on the
steamer, and Heaven send that they all reach their various destinations. You - all of you who read
this - ought to have heard from me before this reaches you.

Dear love from your ever devoted
Mary
