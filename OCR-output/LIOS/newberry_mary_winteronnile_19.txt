than we are of ours. About eleven Doris and I mounted our gallant donkeys and with Malimond
and Nobi running beside us we were off for the Colossi of Memnon. Over the sands winding
among deep hollows where the Nile water is still undried, along a path beaten hard by the feet of
women bearing water jars, between garden patches, along deep cuts, jumping little ditches, and
ﬁnally straight on towards those glaring mountains that make me catch my breath with delight
whenever I look at them - over a dusty road with a cane ﬁeld on the leﬂ and a train of ﬁfty camels
waiting to be loaded; and on the right a ﬁeld presumably meant to be of winter wheat but really of
crested larks ﬁlling the air with their sweet notes. The crested larks and camels absolutely ignored
the Colossi of Memnon and when we got close to them and found we didn't reach, even on the
backs of our chargers, to the tops of their big toes we wished that we too might feel a ﬁne crested
carnelian indifference. Truly, I sometimes get worn out with emotions in this land of mighty
marvels. We rode on a little beyond the Colossi towards Medinet Habu, and an Arab who had
never entered my life before held me up to beg me to take some scarabs back to the Beduin to
show Mr. Davis! "They are real, madam, as you see if only you look". "I do not know", I said
ﬁercely, "the difference between real scarabs and imitation ones, so it's not worth while my
looking". We rode back in a ﬁerce high noon and the air was simply heavenly. As we galloped
around the comer of a mud wall we almost collided with Mr. Crane and Mr. Carter on their way
out to their diggings. They looked almost like a parade, their donkeys were so trapped out in red
tassels. In the aﬁemoon I went over to Luxor with the usual retinue of seven of the crew and
Jones. One of the minor delights of this heavenly time I'm having is the being waited on hand and
foot as if I were a Princess.

I went to Luxor then to leave cards on some people at the Winter Palace and to do an errand or
two. I promised you some time ago that I would not go on raving about sunsets. We've had
them regularly every night, and with the rectitude of a lofty spirit I've kept silent about them. But
you'll have to let me state the bare facts that coming back to the Beduin from Luxor this evening
we were rowing into a brilliant orange that merged into rose color that throbbed up to the feet of
the Evening Star, while from the horizon ﬂared great streamers of pale green. Far down the river
behind us the sky and the water and the very air were of the blue a sapphire would be if opaque,
with snow white sails and creamy walls of houses and ﬂashing lights gleaming against it. And our
right hand oars dipped into melted amethyst and our left into liquid turquoise.

I must stop now. If I write another sheet to this letter ﬁill well I know none of you would have
the patience to read it. "Kulle sana w'inta taiyib" to you all. With oceans of love from

West Bank-Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- It's a whole week since I've written, so this letter will be reminiscent instead of
journalistic like the others. A week ago today we went out to the valley and stayed three days,
and though in some ways it reminded me of my mining life, in others it was a unique experience.
The House in the Valley is seven miles from the Beduin on the west bank. Cousin Theodore,
Doris and Jones rode. I meant to ride but at the last moment found Cousin Emma didn't want to
drive alone, so I drove with her in a sort of surrey thing drawn by two black mules and driven by a
bandit in baggy white trousers. First across the sands straight towards the mountains, then at
right angles along a ticklish shelving road on the edge of a very deep cut, then a sharp turn
towards the mountains again, through a tiny biblical village with palm trees and a well, out again
in a minute into the glare of the desert, and then on a hard white limestone road up to the
mountains and into the mouth of the valley. And there my breath left me - for it was like the
