.Emma and me and trotted over to the Valley to spend the night' while Wen
had to sit tamely on deck like perfect ladies, and dispense tea and
Cakes to strange Americans from Buffalo Whom we had never seen before.
Sir Gaston Maspero was to join them the next morning at the Tombs and
pronounce judgement on the red granite sarcophagus. The next afternoon
I had just got back from a long walk (accompanied by a sailor With a
heavy stick,) packed with fleas which I had annexed in a native village

I suddenly found myself in; and was having tea on deck in company with th(
Contessa Contardone and Mr. Tremaine When the Cavalcade returned from

the Valley. It had quite the effect in a mild way of explorers returning
from the African desert as they came in single file across the sands; fir
the sumpter mule (so to speak) with the luggage, then Cousin T., Doris &
Jones With the donkey boys running beside them, and Julius Caesar bray—
ing his head off as they came. Doris was beaming. She had had the

most wonderful time with Maspero Who had lunched with them in the House
in the Valley and who talked as she never had heard anyone talk before.

He pronounced the sarcophagus a treasure, wants it for the Museum in
Cairo, but also wants Cousin Theodore to pay the insignificant sum of

250 poinds sterling for its transportation there!

The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic the next day at the
great temple of Medinet Habu, to see the magic performances of a noted
Arab snake-charmer she had persuaded to come down from Esneh for the
purpose. We went, and it was an extraordinary experience. V(Doris had
a nasty spill on the way out. Her donkey stepped into a pitfall, flung
her, fell on her and kicked her, but she insisted on going on, With

her usual pluck, and in the end suffered no serious effects). I simply
haven't time to give you an account of what happened at the ruins. It
was both dramatic and astounding. The Arab stalking in front of the
picnic, who all straggled after him, recited some sort of incantation in
a loud clear voice, and lured snakes from out of thornbushes on the
desert and the coy cobra from chinks in the temple Wall.

Yesterday I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace and
carried off a cup (the lst Prize),- not by my OWn prowess but by that
of my partner, a very nice Scotchman named MacNaughton Who played a

corking game.

wThis afiernoon D. & I Went over there again on invitation to Watch a
rather mild but quite amusing gymkhana, and enjoyed ourselves immensely;
And now I must turn in and get some of that sleep that I seem to require
more here than anywhere else in the world.- I suppose now you
cannot get that operation done till the Spring vacation. I wonder if
postponing it was wise.

Oceans of love, dearest, from

Your Mim.

Darling Gopher — . We are now wondering whether Edith was allOWed
to return to New Haven for the Prom proper. In a letter Doris had from
Dick he said he had met you on the street and you had told him of your
hopes and fears (though he didn't put it that way.) ‘I have a feeling
that she did come back. I fancy Mrs. Finch likes now and then to make
a bluff at being very strict and keep people in suspense. I shall await

your description of the Prom with interest -4 and such patience as I
can summon to my aid. It's two weeks since I've had a letter from you.

I was rejoiced yesterday by one from Golden from Mrs. Moses, which
