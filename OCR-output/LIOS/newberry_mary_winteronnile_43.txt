wind, a turbulent river and a thick grey atmosphere. We passed a mile of ﬂamingoes standing in
serried ranks upon the sands, and it was a marvelous sight, though owing to the mistiness of the
morning we could not see their color. It was very cold and the land looked very dreary and
nowhere as beautiful as at Luxor. We arrived at luncheon time and wound a tortuous way among
the titanic chaos of strange rocks that break the channel here, until we found a tying up place by a
little sandy island opposite the Cataract Hotel and near Elephantine. We cavalierly pushed a small
ﬁshing ﬂeet out of the cove we wanted, and if the language was as lurid as it was loud they must
have "cursed us out" quite thoroughly. The ducks nearly died with rapture when their coop was
opened and the river was once more theirs. And the chicken boy was kept busy tearing over to
other coves to shoe them back. Sir Francis and his ladies are born explorers.

Aﬁer luncheon Doris and I, with Amelie, Haneen and a sailor to see that nobody stole us, went
over (via the felucca) to the town and walked along the waterfront which is in itself much more
attractive than the one at Luxor. And the whole region is much more strange and wild and
savage, though much less majestically beautiﬁil. The sun had come out, the air was ﬁne and
bracing and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. To see the bazaar was what we really went for and
we were mad abbut it - not nearly so large of course as the one at Cairo, but - like the country -
so strange and savage with such bewildering things for sale - most of which we wanted. The
leopard skins ﬁlled me with covetousness, but are very expensive. I envied a Frenchman who had
a beauty under his arm as he stood bargaining for a stuffed crocodile. Haneen is an admirable
adjunct to shopping in the bazaars. He laughs sardonically whenever a merchant mentions a price
and if we really want the article he jabbers something in the vernacular, thrusts half the sum
demanded into the outstretched hand, and walks off with the amber beads or the dervish knife or
the Soudanese basket, and is allowed to go in peace. It's very cold here and we expected to sizzle
with heat. ‘

Thursday, March 5. Today Doris and I saw one of the wonders of the world - the great Aswan
Dam, which seemed to me an incredible achievement of engineering. We started immediately
after breakfast, taking a carriage at the Cataract Hotel, and with Haneen to carry our wraps and
the luncheon basket and do our talking. We plunged almost instantly from that highly civilized
hotel courtyard and gardens into an utterly desperate desert — a truly terrible place with none of
the beauty of the desert at Luxor. The ruined little habitations, the ruined little cemeteries, the
strange rocks with inscriptions scattered here and there, only added in my eyes to the general
horror of the desolation. There were about three miles of that and then, again with complete
abmptness, we found ourselves in a charming little oasis of a compound, with neat and pretty
bungalows, lovely trees and gardens and verdant terraces - the little village where the government
employees connected with the dam live. We walked across the barrage, a mile and a quarter, and
the little talking we did was done in exclamations. On one side, within eight feet of the top of the
barrage, lay the Nile in a placid lake. On the other, at least a hundred feet below, through a very
few of the 180 sluices the water thundered and leapt and boiled almost like Niagara at the base of
the falls, and then spread itself out in many streams that ﬂowed among the numberless wild
masses of strange rocks that make up the riverbed in that region. And stretching on all sides the
sand ridges of that fearful desert, sinister and with a look of eternal doom - the very edge of
Savage Africa.

At the far end of the barrage we took a crazy little felucca and sailed to Philae. Alas for that poor,
drowned "Pearl of Egypt"! We stepped out of our boat on to the roof of the temple, the tops of a
few palm trees were apparently ﬂoating on the water which lapped the very capitals of the
columns of that perfect kiosk. A keening and wailing came from one of the islands, and boats
were hastening towards it filled with women who looked like black crows. Haneen said there was
