The felucca had, according to orders, moved up stream till directly opposite the dahabya, and
therefore was lying in front of the tiny native village at which we gaze daily from the Beduin.
While sitting there I had ample opportunity to observe native life, some of which - like Sugar's
behavior - would sully these fair pages if chronicled thereon. The most pleasing episode was the
gambols of the children with two fuzzy black puppies whose sombre fate it is to grow up into
abhorrent, snarling, unloving and unloved Egyptian dogs. Three men in black robes and white
fringed shawls wound around their heads strode down the bank from the hamlet with a small flock
of sheep, which they picked up one by one and deposited in a boat. The animals neither struggled
nor uttered a bleat. Presently in a sort of hurly burly of dust, barking dogs and shouting children,
Cousin T. and Doris, with their escort of donkey boys and sailors, came down the bank, and we
rowed home to the Beduin. We found Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson teaing with
Cousin Emma. Dorothy Richardson is the daughter of Dr. Richardson of Athens and an
uncommonly attractive young woman. Her uncle, Mr. Hardy, is an ex-diplomat of sorts, whom I
suppose I ought to be able to place but can't.

Wednesday, January 15. I crossed over at ten o'clock to play tennis with Dorothy R. on the
Winter Palace court. We had two good sets before the sun grew too fervent, and then I leﬁ her to
her letters and started home for mine. Wednesday is our best mail day. En route to the felucca I
paused at the chemists and whom should I encounter there, buying a toothbrush, but Mrs. Fred
Morley, who for two or three years was my next door neighbor (and a very nice one) in Colorado
Springs! This afternoon Doris invited Dorothy Richardson to ride to Kamak with her, and they
were gone a long time and, Doris said, enjoyed themselves vastly. At tea time we had a visit from
Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero who came down the river in the Dahabya Miriam two days ago and
are to be here a couple of weeks. On Monday he is going over to the valley to give The Last
Word as to the importance of the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah. We are divided
between our hopes that it will be so ﬁne that Maspero will want it in the Cairo Museum, and that
it will fail by a hair's breadth to meet that requirement so that we can give it to the Metropolitan.

I forgot to record that Doris and I were again invited to dinner and the dance last night at the
Winter Palace. I declined, but Don's went and had a lovely time and met a lot of English ofﬁcers

Thursday, Januag 16. Nothing of any particular interest to record today - just a lovely day,
beginning pleasantly with waﬁles and maple syrup, and proceeding with a little too much wind
and therefore sand in the atmosphere. We all stayed by the Beduin this morning but in the
aﬁernoon Doris and I took the felucca and went over to call on Mrs. Morley. She and her son
Fritz are on the Egypt, one of Cook's new Nile steamers, and are here for a couple of days on
their way up the river. We took them over to the Winter palace to show them those lovely
gardens which have grown truly as if by magic in just four years. Incidentally we saw the little
Egyptian gazelle buck looking so dainty and charming it was hard to believe he had recently killed
four of his own children. We had tea on the terrace before separating, the Morleys to return to
the, Egypt and we to the Beduin.

If you could but see the stars from the vantage point of the Nile! Is there any other land I wonder
where Sirius glitters with such a blue diamond light?

Friday, January 17. A lovely morning and a disappointing aﬁemoon. Shortly after ten Doris and
I crossed over the river and went to see Mr. Whymper's pictures. We attracted the attention of
that gentleman by the simple process of whistling outside his window, his room being on the
ground ﬂoor of the Winter Palace. I did the whistling during and in spite of the protests of my
daughter, who seemed to think it a very vulgar proceeding. It has the advantage of giving the
