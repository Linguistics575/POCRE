We had a wonderful mail today, but no letter from you. We had a wonder—
ful ride this afternoon, Cousin T., D. & I. over to Medinet Habu, near
the foot of the mountains, where there are the most beautiful ruins
we've seen yet. V

Goodnight, Darling, and God bless my boy.
Your Loving
Mim

West Bank at Luxor — 10 January 1913

Darling Gopher - It's more than two weeks since I've heard from
you and I'm beginning to be afraid that a letter must have been lost.
As for me I've written you with the utmost regularity, beginning with a
postal from Gib, followed by a letter mailed the minute I arrived in
Naples on the 27th, pursued by another mailed at Alexandria Dec. 2,
since which I’ve written once a Week. A letter just arrived from Jack
Stewart and written on Christmas day says "I suppose Roger has Written
you of his visit to Savannah with Bill Hunter". Of course I am wholly
mystified. Unless a letter comes from you soon, my feeling of remote-
ness will begin to be intolerable.

Things go on happening here with the most delightful frequency and the
days flit by on the wings of the wind. I bask in constant sunlight,

and wear summer clothes, and am beginning to look so young that Cousin
Theodore persistently refers to me, when speaking to Doris, as "Your
sister". Our most recent excitement is a note arrived from Harry Burton
this morning before breakfast saying that he had found (in a new
sepulchral chamber he opened a few days ago) a red granite sarcophagus
with a recumbent figure carved on the lid. The note further said it
Would take about two days to clear away the debris in Which it is em~
bedded= Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones are going to ride over to the
valley tomorrow afternoon and spend the night, and await developments.

I want to go also, but it isn't fair to leave Cousin Emma alone so I'm
going to stay with her. I think I shall ride part way with them for

the sake of the ride, and then come back alone with Mahmoud, my donkey
boy — and possibly one of the crew. When Cousin T., D. & I go out we arl
quite a cavalcade - we-three mounted, and three donkey boys and two
sailors running beside us. I've come to the reluctant conclusion that
my donkey, Sugar, has too small a tummy to cinch a sidesaddle to. My
saddle is continually turning and I have to dismount and hold up the
procession and have it readjusted. Jones thought it might be the fault
of the saddle, and, in his determination to have me suited, the other
‘day he, assited by two donkey boys and six of the crew, saddled and
unsaddled that one small donkey with various sidesaddles While all Luxor
looked on. But no sidesaddle stays put for more than fifteen minutes

on Sugar, so I think I'll have to give him up. I hate to,- he's so
pretty and cunning and makes me think of Kim.

Sunday afternoon we took a rather unusual ride, not visiting any ruins
(which is what we almost always do) but riding through miles of culti—
vated fields where steam ployghs were at work and the water flowing
through cemented irrigating ditches,— all more modern and progressive
than anything we have seen, and quite dull and uninteresting compared

with the native methods.
