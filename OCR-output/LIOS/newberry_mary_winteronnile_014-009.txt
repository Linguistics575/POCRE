Luxor and thank God for all His goodness. But my face was swollen still and Cousin Emma
protested against my going, as the church, she said, was apt to be cold. So we all spent the

morning on the boat. ’

In the afternoon Cousin Theodore, Doris and I and Jones, all in our riding clothes, were rowed
over to Luxor in the felucca, and there our own donkeys and our own saddles and our own
donkey boys were awaiting us, and off we rode to Kamak with our boys running beside us. And
along the waterfront of Luxor Cousin Theodore had an ovation. Lines of dragomans and humble
folk rose to their feet and beamingly shouted a welcome to him. As his own donkey boy said,
kissing his hand, "All the world is thankables that Mr. Davis are come back!" They say he is
known up and down the Nile as "The Friend of the Poor".

It is impossible, I think, for anyone to describe those stupendous ruins with their deathless beauty
and immortal splendor. It seized upon me almost like a sudden grief that stayed till the late
aﬁernoon chill began to tinge the air, and then ambled back on our donkeys. I adore riding a
donkey. Mine is named Sugar, and my delightful little donkey boy, with the most engaging smile,
is Malimond. Yesterday morning Doris and I attended by Malimond and Nobi (Doris's boy) rode
again to Kamak and poked about alone with a map, and felt sorry for people being conducted by
vociferating guides. On getting back to Luxor we joined the Cousins who were walking in the
Winter Palace Gardens with M. Charles Whymper, that delightful Englishman with a much too
loud voice, who writes pleasant books about birds and illustrates them with his own lovely
pictures. Whymper, the mountain climber, was his brother. In the aftemoon Cousin Theodore
and Doris went off on their donkeys across the sands toward the Lybian hills and I, with six of the
crew to row me and the ferocious second captain perched like a gigantic black bird at the stern,
and Jones as escort, went over to Luxor to visit some of the native shops. We paid a visit to
Mohammed Muhassib - the great and reliable dealer in antiquities, and because of his regard for
Cousin Theodore, I was received with pomp and graciousness by the hoary, turbaned old Arab,
and conducted into an inner treasure room where the casual purchaser never penetrates. We had
his youngest grandson, a beguiling baby in yellow satin and fez-shaped cap of white, brought in
and introduced to me. And then he gave me coffee ﬁt for the gods, and I bought a small alabaster
vase, and with many salutations I departed. I heard him telling Jones that one of his wives - "the
old one" had died. They opened the dam at Assonan yesterday - a real attention to me on my

birthday - and the Khedive and Lord Kitchener were there. I'd rather see Lord Kitchener than any
man in the world.

This morning Doris and I were rowed across and spent the best of the morning being shampooed
and manicured. The young German who shampooed me kept ejaculating "Shocking ~ shocking"
at the way my hair fell out. Just after we got back in the Beduin, a steam dahabya ﬂying many
ﬂags, the Stars and Stripes among them, came steaming down the river and people waved to us
from the deck, and we knew it was the Serapis with Emily Morgan and Miss Nelson and the rest
of the Tuck party. And as soon as we could after luncheon we rowed over and called. And it
was a joy indeed to see those two dear things. They are coming to tea tomorrow aﬁernoon,
which will make Christmas seem a little more like Christmas.

Artin Pasha has got our party somewhat confused. I've had a note from him addressed to "Mrs.

Burton" and beginning "My dear Mrs. Burton". Harry came over from the valley this aﬁemoon to

spend Christmas, and I asked him if I were his mother or if he had married me for my money. He
was terribly teased.-

l4We passed Kasr-es-Saiyad ("the Hunter's Castle") today and saw an amazing sight. What well
might have been a castle was a pigeon house and nothing else. Hundreds of thousands of pigeons
were perched upon its battlements, wheeling over it, swooping about it, while fresh ﬂocks were
hurrying towards it from all directions. Opposite Kasr-es-Saiyad lies Hon, the home of Shjekh
Seline who died a few years ago after sitting stark naked on the banks of the Nile for 53 years.
They have built his tomb on the sacred spot and the natives make pilgrimages to it.

We expect to reach Luxor tomorrow and I shall begin a fresh letter there. It will be good to get
letters. Ten days without mail is a long while.

Adios, my dears all, and Heaven bless you.

 

Devotedly,
Mary
Christmas Eve 1912.
Dahabya Beduin
Luxor, Egypt

"By the fertile stream
Where, in Egyptian Thebes, the heaps of precious ingots gleam,
The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state
Of valiant men with steeds and cars
March through each massy gate."

Don't you love that, Adeline? And to think that I am here! I cannot get used to the wonder of
that. We reached here at noon on Saturday, a day like all our days - soaked in sunshine. We
slipped "past garden wall and gallery" with glimpses of those lovely columns of the Temple of
Luxor in between; past the Winter Palace, and then diagonally across the river to our mooring
place on the west bank. We have it all to ourselves because most people prefer to herd in the
thick of things on the east bank with their noses bumping each other's tails, until there isn't an inch
left in which to tie a boat. So we are sole owners at present of a wide and lovely beach, back of
which stretches a wondrous plain of strips of burning sand and strips of brilliant green and lines of
trees, and back of all the glaring ﬁercely beautiful Libyan mountains where our valley lies. We
made an encampment with the dahabya, a tent for the sailors, a lot of stylish yellow poles to which
the clothes lines are attached, and two luxurious yellow coops into which the poultry farm is
shoved at sunset. It was too amusing when the small coops were ﬁrst lifted off the Beduin onto
the sand and opened. Sir Francis Drake and his three ladies waddled madly for the edge of the
bank, slid down it on their tails and hurled themselves into the water. The turkeys were so stiff
they could hardly Stand at ﬁrst, but in less than ﬁve minutes the gobbler was strutting and rustling
and gobbling as though he owned upper Egypt, including the Sudan, while the hen turkey was
busily superintending one of the crew polishing copper pots with sand. To see the white cock
steppingjauntily about no one would have imagined him to be a heart—broken widower, all his
wives having been eaten on the way up. Perhaps he foresaw that he would have three more in
about an hour and a half. At luncheon the mail was brought from across the river, our ﬁrst in 10
days, and we buried ourselves in letters. There was a dear one from you, Adeline. The aﬁemoon
waned in perfect beauty, of which I recked nothing, having suddenly gone to bed with a ﬁendish
attack of neuralgia in my face. It passed aﬁer four or ﬁve hours and I slept like an infant and
woke up Sunday morning very ﬁt indeed and wishing greatly to go to the English Church at

13was too shallow for the felucca to reach the shore. Before we knew where we were "at", Doris
and I had been lightly and skillﬁilly picked up, carried through the water and gently deposited in
the boat. One of the marked features of Asyut was that during our entire progress through it we
did not see a single white person, though there must be a number of English in residence. I
promise not to go on raving about sunsets - but tonight there was one, the beauty of which was
beyond anything I ever dreamed of; when I thought it was over and done with it had only just
begun. Egyptian sunsets will now be a part of what I mean when I say in the Gloria in Excelsis
"We thank Thee for Thy great glory."

Wednesday, December 18. I almost forgot to get dressed this morning in my absorption watching
the panorama on the eastern bank as I hung out of the window. They had all seemed to garb
themselves with an eye to symphonies. Two tan colored sheep were being driven by a man and a
boy in tan colored robes. A man shrouded in black was riding a black buﬁalo. Another black
buﬁ‘alo had a man in black tagging at his tail. A camel swung along with his rider clad in camel
color with a rose scarf around his neck - nothing could have been better.

Doris has made two astounding statements today. Possibly wearied by my oft-repeated
exclamations of wonder at the skill with which the women carry their water jars on their heads,
she announced she was sure she could do it herself. "Not full" said I. "Yes, ﬁill." "How far?"
"Oh, quite a distance." "You don't really think you could!" "Yes, I do." On being pinned down
relentlessly, she admitted that it might be wise for her to wear a bathing suit while doing it.
Statement No. 2 was when Cousin T. and I joined her on deck this morning and she announced
that a ﬂock of cranes numbering at least a thousand had ﬂown overhead. We couldn't make her
come down a single crane. Yesterday I saw a lovely ﬂight of snow-white ones, wheeling over a
sandbar and then settling on it.

The most spectacular thing on the shores today has been the stunning cliffs of the debel-el-
Harideh, with ancient quam'es and tombs, and - way up a gorge - an altar to a serpent with
miraculous healing powers. There is a yearly eight-day festival in honor of said snake, a festival
to which the Nile boatmen ﬂock. We've seen scores of shadufs working the last few days, but this
aftemoon we heard for the ﬁrst time the musical, lonely cry of the men who work them. Also as
our dahabya was passing one man, he strode down the bank, yanked off his one and only garment
and proceeded to wash it in the river. And the queer thing is you don't mind. Don't ask me why
this is so because I don't know why. We overhauled a dahabya this aﬁemoon ﬂying the English

ﬂag. Her name was Enterpe. As she was sailing unassisted by any tug, we easily ran away from
her. We have made seventy-two miles today.

Thursday, December 19. Today has been made up of sunshine (as always) delicious warmth,
enchanting sights on the shores, and birds innumerable. I myself counted sixty-two pelicans
sitting on one sandbar. We have three little birds of our own, wag-tails, that ﬂy along with us and
eat cake after tea till they spoil their ﬁgures and actually begin to waddle. We are tied up tonight
. near Nag Hamadi, and the Masperos are tied up on the other side of the river. They started two
days ahead us, but their boat is a heavy old thing.

F riday, December 20. We were late in leaving Nag Hamadi this morning because the tug had to
take on ﬁve tons of coal. Sixteen natives sat motionless. on the bank and watched me for half an

hour undoing a snarl in my knitting silk. It's their capacity for sitting motionless, I think, that has

earned them their reputation for laziness, for they certainly can worlg they are alert in their
movements and they never grow fat.

12imagined bordered the Nile on both sides of its entire length. Also we've had clouds and two or
three dashes of rain and strong winds that have blown the sand till the air has been full of a foglike
mist.

And now I really must write to my mother and my son and a few other persons who will stop
loving me if I don't. This will be posted at Asyut tomorrow, and unless something particularly

interesting happens I shall add no more to this edition. Except always my faithful love to my dear
DuBois, Blake and Mitchell friends.

Tuesday, December 17.
The Beduin on the Nile, somewhere near Abutig and

about 260 miles south of Cairo.

Dearest Adeline:- I'm not going to treat you to the best writing paper every time. If I used it all
up on my personal correspondence 1 might cease to be persona grata on the Beduin. But this is
the Royal Cambrian Writing Pad, which sounds as though it ought to suit the most exacting.

We did not get to Asyut until one today, but our last hour of daylight yesterday was one never to
be forgotten. For at least an hour we were skimming past the base of giant cliffs rising sheer from
the river - the wonderﬁil Gebel Abu Feda. Really cafe-au-lait in color they were glowing with
tints of unearthly beauty caught from the orange and rose sunset going on across the river. Their
jagged summits cut into a sky of such ecstatic blue that it made my throat contract. (perfect color
does that to me.) And high above the mast rode a silver half moon. Never before have I seen a
really silver moon. .

We reached Asyut at luncheon time. Doris and I bolted that meal in haste and went ashore with
Haneen as bodyguard, to take a drive through the town. We had to land in the felucca, and it was
very pleasant being rowed by six Arabs handling their oars with a man—of-war's precision. We
drew up at the bottom of a steep bank done in rough masonry and by means of a mariner at each
elbow and my own active strides I was wafted to the top like a withered leaf. (It is my regard for
the Eternal Fitness of Things that made me say withered leaf instead of lotus ﬂower, as I wanted
to.) In a rickety Victoria with a woolly yellow mat seething with ﬂeas under our feet, and Haneen
perched beside the driver, who wore his turban at a rakish angle acquired only by the few, and
who shouted every foot of the way to clear the road, we proceeded through the bazaar and the
market. The bazaar was like Cairo, only not nearly so interesting, but the market (it was market
day) was more than worth seeing. A mass of people, bulls, camels, donkeys in a dust trodden
space with walls on three sides and the fourth open to heavenly green ﬁelds, and an imposing
mountain in the background with an ancient burying ground and the ruins of the old city at its

foot.

Asyut is a prosperous and wealthy town, with many pretentious houses owned by rich natives,
and some charming bungalows evidently inhabited by English people. The one other ﬂaw, besides
the yellow mat, to our expedition was the way the driver lashed the horses. “Haneen, make him
stop whipping his horses." A word from Haneen which took effect for a minute and a half.
"Haneen, tell him not to beat his horses." ‘A minute of respite. "Hang, it displeases me to have
the horses beaten. Make him st_op." Fierce remarks in the vernacular from Haneen, ﬁve minutes
peace, then the wallopings were resumed and I gave up. You might have an apoplexy or burst a
blood vessel trying to prevent it, and all in vain. The Beduin had moved up stream and the water

11Friday, December 13. This is a land of pure delight. I‘ve spent the entire day, practically, on
deck, absorbed in watching shores Cousin Theodore pronounces "dull". The ﬁrst thing we saw
after breakfast (we started about an hour before we were up) was that strange monument the
Arabs call the "false pyramid" - the Pyramid of Meidum, built in three concentric towers, the
central one the highest. To me it's much more impressive than the other pyramids. The scenery
today has been less spectacular than yesterday, but everything is so fascinating and there is no
stretch so desolate but that you see some human ﬁgures, these splendid ﬁgures in their always
artistic robes - not blue as in Cairo where nine-tenths of the natives wear the most heavenly
shades of blue, but in sharp contrast of black and white. Sometimes it will be a solitary ﬁgure
seated brooding by the Nile, far from any habitation, or a group of women ﬁlling their water jars
at the river, men working at a shaduf or, most delightﬁil of all to me, a frieze-like effect against
the sky (when the road runs along the top of a high embankment) or a camel loaded so with cane
that you can only see his legs, a woman with a water jar upon her head, a donkey ambling along
with a shrouded Arab sitting on his tail (almost), a camel with a rider swaying on his back, - I
never in a thousand years could get tired of it. The strangest village we have seen today we did
not at ﬁrst recognize as a village - it so melted into the hills behind it, as bare and desolate as they
- the whole scene made up of burning sand, glaring rocks and sun-baked mud, except, clear down
in the foreground by the river, a tiny square of emerald grass with three lovely trees. Presently we
came to the most fascinating sight of the aﬁemoon - on a point at a bend in the river, and
surrounded by palms, the cream colored Coptic Convent of Mar Antonios, with a splendid tree
top springing up through the roof. Back of the convent starts a caravan route to the Red Sea.
Just before the luminous dusk began to steal about us we slipped past an estate with a villa of
importance and many outhouses and all the air of belonging to Someone-in Particular - perhaps to
"Our Mother of the Khedive" as the dragoman say. And from beneath the giant palms three
camels arose at the bidding of an Arab and slipped down to the river to ﬁll up their ﬁfteen
stOmachs.

Saturday, December 14. And Doris' birthday. We have passed through scenes today considered
uninteresting by those who have been up the river twenty-two and down it twenty two. But Doris
and I loved every foot of it. About the middle of the aﬁemoon we tied up to an island in order
that the tug might coal at Shekh-Fadl, a town with a huge sugar factory close by on the mainland.
Doris and I immediately took to the island for a walk, with one of the crew as bodyguard. I
privately scouted the idea of the necessity when we started out but changed my mind before our
return. An Arab of your own carrying a stout stick is a comforting appendage when you meet
other Arabs in lonely stretches. Our island had no houses, but it did have numerous vegetable
gardens. It was much larger than we thought when we ﬁrst undertook to walk around it.
Walking in the powdery sand along the shore was tiring, and then I proved that between persons
of intelligence community of language is not necessary. "Why", said I to our Arab, who knows
not a word of English, "can't we cross over here to the boat?" "Because", said he in Arabic, of
which I know only the oneword "Kaddah" (liar), “we may not walk through the standing crop."

Sunday, December 15.— and the ﬁrst warm morning that we've had. We have passed close to the
base of giant limestone cliffs where hordes of white—robed men were quarrying and tumbling great
pieces of gleaming rock down to the water's edge. The sunshine on the scene made a blinding
glare, but it was very beautiful; and then came the splendid Gehelet-Ter ("Bird Mountain") rising
sheer from the water, and on its summit the Convent of Der el Adra ("Our Lady Mary the
Virgin"). It is also called the Convent of the Pulley, because visitors used to be hauled up by that
device. Now there are steps cut in the rock, and as we looked there came bounding down them
with incredible speed a woman with a water jar on her head. Today we have seen for the ﬁrst
time those long, long stretches of brilliant green close to the river's edge, which in my childhood I

10'heart, blue robes with gay bandanas tied about the waist and white turbans. All except the two
captains, who wear black robes and no sashes. And also except Haneen the butler, whose raiment
is much more important. He, I believe, is a Capt. and wears a fez instead of a turban. The second
captain is a wholly ferocious looking individual. He looks as though he'd like to cut all our
throats for the simple pleasure of doing it. But he's been on the Beduin for years and is a great
friend of Jones, so I suppose he won't. There was a rose and orange and gold and turquoise and
violet and dove grey and sea green sunset tonight and the slenderest thread of a new moon anyone
ever saw. We hope to get off tomorrow. We are merely waiting for the tug which is to tow us.

Wednesday, December 11.

No tug appeared today; instead there came a young man from the ﬁrm of whom the tug is
engaged, a gay and smiling youth named Schwartz, who announced that a telegram had come
saying the tug was coaling at some place up the river and would anive early in the morning. "A
day late," I said. The Elders were napping so Doris and I were conducting the interview. "A day
late", he said with a gay shrug, "but what is a day?". " Nothing in Egypt" I had to admit, and truly
it has been so interesting watching the lazy life of the river that I don't care at all whether we go
or stay. Mr. Schwartz plied us with questions, winding up with "This is a government boat?"
"No, it is Mr. Davis' own. He had it built.“ "And you are going up the river alone?" "There are
four of us." "But how dull! Me, I should want sixteen in the party!" Think of having to be polite
for ten or eleven days in the narrow conﬁnes of a dahabya, to sixteen people! Doris and I would
not in the least object to one man - the vastly amusing Harry Burton - but he went to Luxor by
train last night, there being no room for him on the Beduin.

Thursday, December 12. The tug came before we were up this morning, but we had to

wait till the bridge opened at ten. It was very entertaining to see people trying to get across
before the bridge should become useless, as such, for an hour and a half. Doris and I fell into an
unseemly ﬁt of giggling over a ﬁmeral, all on foot, "beating" it over the bridge as though they
were going to a ﬁre. When the draw swung we slipped through, followed by another dahabya
ﬂying the Stars and Stripes. We have no idea whose she is - we only know we sailed away from
her early in the day and have had no glimpse of her since.

It has been a vivid Egyptian day with all that that means of light and color. And what scenes!
How can I even try to give the faintest idea of their strangeness, their charm, their savage or
seductive beauty? And the River itself -' small wonder that people have worshipped it for
centuries. It has a human personality which I feel. For long aﬁer leaving Cairo we passed towns
or scattered habitations more or less Cairo—like in their look and construction - cream colored
walls and an air of civilization. Those came to an end and then there were long stretches of
country, scattered native villages made of mud, with a beauty all their own, towering palms here
and there — large’ groves of them sometimes - then the grain ﬁelds with. a hum of industry about
them and great barges being loaded or unloaded - and always behind them on the East Shore the
Arabian desert with its line of hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, ﬁerce, desolate, burning,
superbly beautiﬁil beneath the magic of the Egyptian sun, but intolerable to even imagine under a
gloomy sky. At sunset we tied up to the bank between two tiny native hamlets. To eﬁ‘ect the
tying up process one of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder (this is a true
statement) and worries it into the sand; two of the crew go ashore each with an enormous
wooden pin the size of a country hitching post; two more of the crew, armed with gigantic
wooden mallets, hammer these pins into the sand and to these we are tied. Then a desert stillness
settles down upon us, while the stars blaze out overhead.
