On Wednesday Doris nnd I had one of the pleasant checks of our lives
When a bout drew up beside the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet.
None of our Cleveland letters had mentioned that they Were coming nbro~d
so it was an absolute surprise. They had come up the river on the
Rameses III, and left for Aswan the next day, but they are to be here
for a week on their return. I went over to the Rameses to call on

Mrs. Dodge. I think she was quite cross because neither Paige nor
Howard Eells had Written me they were coming.

Tuesday Doris and I had a lovely time. Harry had invited us to come

oveb to the valley so as to show us the tomb of Horemheh and me the
sarcophagus in Siphtah, and then to have luncheon with him at the House.
We had breakfast an hour earlier than usual, and then started off on our
donkeys with our donkey boys and a sailor as escort, and Jones to follow
us soon as he had got Cousin Theodore started for the day. We rode

along the river's edge as far as the ferry landing place directly opposits
Luxor, before turning toward the Range. The ferry landing that morning
was worth going miles to see. Two steamers had come up the night before
and scores upon scores of people and donkeys and sandcarts and carriages
had come across to take some of the numerous expeditions on this side.
The gay trappings of the donkeys, the blue and white clothes of the
donkey boys with a dash of red on their chests all made fine coloring;
seven native policemen in Khaki, with their cames Waiting for them in the
background, the bustle and confusion and everybody yelling at once — it
Was all immensely entertaining to me. It was a perfectly delicious day,
like all our days, and I did enjoy the ride. The light and color on the
Libyan Range as we neared it were more marvellous than anything I've

ever seen, -surpassingly beautiful, but so blinding we had to pull down
our chifon veils. The tombs were intensely interesting, especially

the paintings on the walls of Horemheh. The unfinished part interested
me even more than the beauty of the completed work;— it was just as thoug'
the artist - dead thousands of years ago - had laid down his pencil and
brushes to go home to luncheon. Our luncheon at the House with Harry
and Mr. Crane was a very éolly affair7_and at three we started for home,
getting back at teatime and finding the dahabya seething with people.

One other day this week I was invited by the Contessa Contardone to go

to Karnak with a small’party, of whom the Russian Princess Gortsohokoff
was one. VKarnak is always one of the most wonderful places in the world,
but that afternoon it was secondary in my eyes to the Princess with whom
I fell madly in love. Think of a Princess - a real one — like those in
novels and storybooks; young, lithe, beautiful, ascinating, quiet and
absolutely simple in her manner. I couldn't keep my eyes off her.

We watched the workman excavatin a large and beautiful jar and hoped it
would be packed with jewels, but when it Was emptied nothing but a brick
materialized. We paid a visit to the uncanny goddess Sekmet, she with
the lion's head. It is a life-sized statue of black granite which stands
in a dusky room in the temple of Ptah, lighted only by a small square
window high up in the roof. When you've looked at the creature for five
minutes she seems so alive that you sympathize with the Arabs who believe
that she sometimes prowls forth and eats people.

Endless love, dearest, from
Your Him.

I long to see you. I don't know how I can wait till June. Are you
coming to any definite decision as to whether you will go to Utah or not

next summer? I had a letter from Mr. Walcott that shocked me sweetly-
