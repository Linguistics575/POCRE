‘Just as I was leaving the boat, after calling, I had the thrill of

seeing no less a person than Rudyard Kipling, who wns a fellow passenger
of the Byers family. Doris dined with the Byers that evening and went
out to Knrnuk with them to see those matchless ruins by moonlight. The
Byers said D. Was a perfect godsend, because until that evening their son
and brother had not laughed since he left America. He told me he didn't
Want to come at all - that his family had dragged him.

Yesterday I went over to lunch at the Luxor Hotel with the Contessa di
Contardone di Villa Marina. You don‘t have to call her all that — just
Countess or Contessa. She is an Englishwoman who made the mistake of

her life in marrying an Italian, now haply dead, leaving her a widow for
the second time. Her first husband was an Irishman named Jameson, who
died while on an expedition into Central Africa with tnnley; and to hear
her tell the story was a rare experience. She is a sister of Sir Mortimer
Durand who was ambassador from England to Washington some time ago. She
seems to like Doris and me as much as we do her, — though Heaven knows

she can't find us a hundredth part as interesting as we do her

Rest Beloved — Your letter of the 9th has just come and it made
me weep —'I feel so awfully about Crosson Hayes. What a perfectly dread-
ful thing to have happen. The thought of what he must.have suifered made
me feel so sick I didn't want any luncheon, and I'm so low in my mind I'm
afraid this wont be a cheerful letter.

And now I Want to explain why I've written so much more elaborate letters
to Adeline than to you. I knew she was going to miss me more even than
you, because she lives such a shut—in life with so few distractions and
almost no occupations; and so I have written those letters to her as full
and as well as my very limited leisure permitted. Then, too, I truly
would not quite have dared to write such long screeds to you for fear

you wouldn't read them. Very few young men have the patience to read
long letters. Edward Firth told me that he sometimes carried a letter
from his mother for a week in his packet without-reading it. Of course

I know you wouldn't do that, for our relations with each other are quite
