grey aﬁemoon (we've not yet seen the sun in Cairo). And perhaps it was the absence of the ﬁerce
blue background that disappointed me at ﬁrst. But when we had teaed at the Mena House and
started home along that wonderful road with its endless procession of startling ﬁgures of men and
beasts and veiled women (I had an uncanny feeling that we were driving through the Old
Testament in a motor car) - we had only to turn our heads a little to see those strange and
splendid monuments against the blood red sky of the sunset.

Wednesday, December 4. Another grey day, but it doesn't matter in the least. Why should it, in a
land where everything is a thousand times more enchanting even than you expected it to be? I
had to stay in the hotel this morning doing dull but necessary things while the others went off and
amused themselves. But this afternoon we motored out through that extraordinary new suburb
Heliopolis, the perpetration of a German Syndicate drunk with power - and out into the desert
until it was easy to believe that there was nothing in all the world but wide wastes and ridges and
deep hollows of grey and shifting sands. We stopped on our homeward way for tea at the
Heliopolis Palace Hotel, and watched people of various nationalities from those who spoke an
unknown tongue to nice Englishmen with darling dogs. The cousins have seen all the wonders of
this land for so many years that they "cannot", as Doris told Artin Pasha this aﬁemoon - "cannot
understand why we are so wild with excitement whenever we see a camel." (Indeed Doris riding
a camel in Cairo would be much less conspicuous that she is on a horse in New Haven.) Artin
Pasha, an Armenian archaeologist of distinction, and Prof. Sayce, Oxford Don, scientist of great
renown, called this aﬁernoon and talked delightﬁilly. Artin Pasha wore his fez all the time, and I
have to confess looked the "unspeakable Turk", blear-eyed and with a rather dreadﬁil nose, and

the Oxford Don wore a collar of prehistoric vintage, light brown socks and chopped-off Congress
gaiters of black.

Thursday, December 5. Today Cairo has basked in sunlight, but it's been a "white day", the sky
lacking the deep Egyptian blue and the air somewhat hazy. We went to the Zoo, which was
enchanting, visited the Beduin - our dahabeah - and I wish everybody I know and care for could
see it. It's a beauty. Jones and Amelie, and the crew and native servants (20 in nUmber) were all
engaged in getting things spick and span. A small ﬂock of ducks came paddling frantically up
when whistled for and gobbled the bread I threw them. We are to move on board Monday and
start early Tuesday morning. This aﬁemoon we went to the Citadel and entered that wonderful
mosque of Mohammed Ali, the minarets of which are so ethereal, so exquisite, you almost fear
they will vanish as you watch them. We did not have to put off our shoes from off our feet, but
we had to slip huge yellow slippers over them.

Things go on being as deliciously strange as ever; a man sits on a bench in the Zoo and is shaved
by an itinerant barber; a tall athletic ﬁgure clad in a heavenly blue garment strides across the street
with three dried crocodiles under his arm, and no one but 615 Orange Street even turns to look at
him. Every time we'emerge upon the terrace of Shepheard's, fakirs with monkeys, cobras and
mongooses meet our enraptured gaze, and the riot of color satisﬁes even my color loving soul.

knew in England and who lives in Livomo. It was so deliciously un-American; this was it: "My
