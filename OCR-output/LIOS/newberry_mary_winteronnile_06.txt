Tuesday, November 26. Just a word more. We are due in Naples tomorrow at the crude hour of
SIX and I've got the most part of my packing still to do and another long letter to write, and it's
evemng. The Mediterranean was perfectly lovely all day yesterday, and the coast of Africa
strange and haunting and majestic. There was snow upon the mountain tops. It was after dark
when we reached Algiers and Cousin Theodore wouldn't let Doris and me go ashore even with
Jones. "They're all of them beasts in that town“, he said shortly. So what we saw of Algiers was
from the deck, and the lights and the tiers upon tiers of dim white homes rising to the top of the
hill made a lovely effect. It's been choppy today and not quite so clear, but Sardinia has been with

us most of the time - looking easily the haunt of bandits. We are crazy to get to Naples. Two
days there and then we sail again on the 29th for Alexandria.

Our love to you and Augustus and to Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Blake, to whom this is to go next
and then to the dear Mitchells in Summerville, please.

Always your devoted
Mary

Saturday, November 30.
The Mediterranean.

Dearest Adeline:- It was perfectly glorious Wednesday morning when we arrived at Naples.
Bumping and banging and yelling began so early that even Doris the Dormouse was up and
exclaiming over Vesuvius at six. But our party, being a slow and stately one, were almost the last
to get off the steamer. The Grand Hotel had sent a special carriage for us, and away we drove,
unencumbered by anything except a small black bag with jewels, while Jones and Amelia looked
aﬁer the forty odd pieces of luggage. (It is really forty something in number.) As we drove
along, Doris and I beaming with delight suddenly held up by two leaping, shouting bandits, who
turned out to be Harry Burton, the delightful young Englishman who goes with us to Egypt, and
my dear Jim Whittaker, who had come all the way ﬁ‘om Florence (a twelve hour journey) just to
meet us. The Grand Hotel is a perfect place to stay, being directly on the bay with the most
heavenly views in all directions, and soldiers always drilling in the daytime, and wandering
rninstrels always singing by night in the street outside. Cousin Emma declined to drive that A.M.,
so Cousin T., Doris and Harry went off in one carriage and Jim and I in another, and climbed and
climbed among reddening vineyards and stone pines, and along the mountain road to Pasolippo
(don't know how it spells itself) with its gorgeous outlook. Jim and I got out and leaned on a
stone wall and watched in a ﬁeld, very far below us, twelve mounted buglers prancing about and
bugling, apparently to accustom their horses to the sounds, the really beautiﬁil sounds they made.
That aﬁemoon we all tea-ed at Bertolini's and when I stepped out on that terrace in the skies and
saw the kingdoms of the earth spread out before me I almost died of the beauty of it. Before
starting for Bertolini's, Jim, Doris and I had paid a visit to the Aquarium, which Mr. Agassiz used
to tell us was the ﬁnest in the world. It's small enough for one to see all the wonders without
getting tired to death. Never have I beheld anything as disgusting as the devilﬁsh. It did what the
Atlantic Ocean is powerless to do - it made me seasick. But I was revived by the antics of a crab
that did a skirt dance for our beneﬁt till we were in hysterics. That evening while the others were
playing cards, Jim and I went to the music room and he sang. If I were young he would have
sung the heart out of me. He's got a lovely voice with a quality in it that tears you to pieces.

Thursday. Thanksgiving Day, - with nothing to remind us of it except the many, many things we
have to be thankﬁil for, - was horrid, cloud and rain and mist blotting out everything. Jim and
Doris and I went to the Museum in the morning and stayed until Doris announced that she was so
