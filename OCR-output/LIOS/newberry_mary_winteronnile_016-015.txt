than we are of ours. About eleven Doris and I mounted our gallant donkeys and with Malimond
and Nobi running beside us we were off for the Colossi of Memnon. Over the sands winding
among deep hollows where the Nile water is still undried, along a path beaten hard by the feet of
women bearing water jars, between garden patches, along deep cuts, jumping little ditches, and
ﬁnally straight on towards those glaring mountains that make me catch my breath with delight
whenever I look at them - over a dusty road with a cane ﬁeld on the leﬂ and a train of ﬁfty camels
waiting to be loaded; and on the right a ﬁeld presumably meant to be of winter wheat but really of
crested larks ﬁlling the air with their sweet notes. The crested larks and camels absolutely ignored
the Colossi of Memnon and when we got close to them and found we didn't reach, even on the
backs of our chargers, to the tops of their big toes we wished that we too might feel a ﬁne crested
carnelian indifference. Truly, I sometimes get worn out with emotions in this land of mighty
marvels. We rode on a little beyond the Colossi towards Medinet Habu, and an Arab who had
never entered my life before held me up to beg me to take some scarabs back to the Beduin to
show Mr. Davis! "They are real, madam, as you see if only you look". "I do not know", I said
ﬁercely, "the difference between real scarabs and imitation ones, so it's not worth while my
looking". We rode back in a ﬁerce high noon and the air was simply heavenly. As we galloped
around the comer of a mud wall we almost collided with Mr. Crane and Mr. Carter on their way
out to their diggings. They looked almost like a parade, their donkeys were so trapped out in red
tassels. In the aﬁemoon I went over to Luxor with the usual retinue of seven of the crew and
Jones. One of the minor delights of this heavenly time I'm having is the being waited on hand and
foot as if I were a Princess.

I went to Luxor then to leave cards on some people at the Winter Palace and to do an errand or
two. I promised you some time ago that I would not go on raving about sunsets. We've had
them regularly every night, and with the rectitude of a lofty spirit I've kept silent about them. But
you'll have to let me state the bare facts that coming back to the Beduin from Luxor this evening
we were rowing into a brilliant orange that merged into rose color that throbbed up to the feet of
the Evening Star, while from the horizon ﬂared great streamers of pale green. Far down the river
behind us the sky and the water and the very air were of the blue a sapphire would be if opaque,
with snow white sails and creamy walls of houses and ﬂashing lights gleaming against it. And our
right hand oars dipped into melted amethyst and our left into liquid turquoise.

I must stop now. If I write another sheet to this letter ﬁill well I know none of you would have
the patience to read it. "Kulle sana w'inta taiyib" to you all. With oceans of love from
Mary

Januagl 3, 1913.
West Bank-Luxor

Dearest Adeline:- It's a whole week since I've written, so this letter will be reminiscent instead of
journalistic like the others. A week ago today we went out to the valley and stayed three days,
and though in some ways it reminded me of my mining life, in others it was a unique experience.
The House in the Valley is seven miles from the Beduin on the west bank. Cousin Theodore,
Doris and Jones rode. I meant to ride but at the last moment found Cousin Emma didn't want to
drive alone, so I drove with her in a sort of surrey thing drawn by two black mules and driven by a
bandit in baggy white trousers. First across the sands straight towards the mountains, then at
right angles along a ticklish shelving road on the edge of a very deep cut, then a sharp turn
towards the mountains again, through a tiny biblical village with palm trees and a well, out again
in a minute into the glare of the desert, and then on a hard white limestone road up to the
mountains and into the mouth of the valley. And there my breath left me - for it was like the

16Thesailors - our sailors - have been rejoicing this evening, sitting in a circle on the lower deck
Singing songs that sounded like heathen incantations - all this because Cousin Theodore has given
them a sheep for a feast tomorrow. I would like to hear someone sing Heilige Nacht. The glory
of the Lord is ﬁlling the heavens. There is such moonlight as New England never has known.

Christmas Night, 1912 - It's rather queer that snow and Yule logs and holly should be so
essentially a part of the ideal Christmas to the Anglo-Saxon mind, when of course the [ea_l
Christmas surroundings are like Doris's and Emily's and mine today - delicious sunshine and
warmth, tropical vegetation, arid desert stretches. Just for today I would gladly have exchanged
all this for the snow and the Yule log and Home. We had our presents before and at breakfast,
and when the dining room table was cleared the ceremony of giving the crew and inside servants
(there are 23 of these, mostly Nubians) their Christmas, took place. Cousin Theodore and Cousin
Emma sat at the table, Doris and I on the divan, and Jones was master of ceremonies. They came
in one by one, kissed our hands, said "Kulle sana w'uita taiyib" (a Happy New Year to you), each
received a white shawl, a box of cigarettes, a bag of nuts and candy and some money. When it
was over with they gathered on the deck and shouted "Hip, hip, hip, Hooray! Tank you, tank you,
tank you!“ And the rest of us washed our hands in dioxygen.

Doris and Emily and I went to the little white stucco English church, which stands at the back of
the Luxor Hotel gardens, walking among palms and acacias and other lovely things to get to it,
and arriving in time to see an Arab give the ﬁnal vigorous rings to the outside bell. The church
was trimmed with palms and poinsettias, and of course there was the dear old service and the
joyﬁil Christmas hymns, and a quite unusual thrill at the prayer for "The President of the United
States" even though he was tacked on at the tail end of the Royal

Family. ‘

Doris and I brought Harry Burton and Mr. Crane back in the felucca to have luncheon with us,
and the Beduin looked more that ordinarily beautiﬁil in her gala dress of many ﬂags. Mr. Crane is
an artist and son of the better known Walter Crane, a very nice fellow and with a decided sense of
humor, though not as constantly amusing as Harry Burton. We had a gay luncheon, and when the
young men had departed for the other side of the river, Don's and I were free to read our ﬁne crop
of letters, and we did it with a ravenous appetite. At four the Serapis with all her ﬂags ﬂying
steamed up near us and her felucca brought over Mr. and Mrs. Tuck, Major Curley, Miss Nelson
and Emily - and you can all of you easily imagine what it meant to Don's and me to have even an
hour of Miss Nelson and Emily. We took the whole party all over the Beduin and they were crazy
about it. Then we had tea on deck with the Nile ﬂowing by us on one side and our splendid plain
and mountains on the other and sunshine and beauty everywhere. We could not bear to have our
guests leave, but they leﬁ, and then Cousin Theodore and I took a walk on the sands with the
sunset in our faces, and had to hurry back to escape the sudden mists that always arrive at
sundown. We found Nicoll, the English artist who paints such exquisite pictures of Egypt, calling
on us. I liked him immensely. He was asked to stay to dine, but had a previous engagement. So
we four dined alone and had so much to eat before the turkey arrived that he was sent off
untouched. But we had to nibble at the plum pudding. I pledged you all in champagne, and later
on saw one of the crew dancing a sort of double shufﬂe with the bottle balanced on his head. It
has been a lovely Christmas in its queer way, but Emily and the letters and remembrances from
home were far and away the best part of it.

Thursday, December 26. The Serapis went on her way to Cairo this morning. It is a very great
disappointment to Doris and me that they did not stay long enough for us to do things together 7
and to Emily and Miss Nelson too. But they are, at present, no more the arbiters of their destinies
