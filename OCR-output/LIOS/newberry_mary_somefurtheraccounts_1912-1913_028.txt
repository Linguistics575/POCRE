they are asked to meet us. The Luckrafts are in town and being
awfully nice to us, and so is Lily Solly. Mrs. Bell is still in
America. We've done a lot of motoring through this lovdy English
country= It's a heavenly time of year to be here, but the weather
has been horrid. We motored to Oxford yesterday and on our way bnc]
stopped at Stoke Poges, where Wm. Penn was born, and saw the equis.
and very cheerful churchyard where Grey wrote his Elegy. We also .
came through Eton and saw scores of Eton boys in their silk hats.
Their ends didn't correspond — for almOSt all of them wore slovenly
Unpolished shoes.

D. and I have been to three picture galleries and have seen such
hauntingly lovely things that if it weren't for my darling son andx
hankering to see him, I’d like to stay here another month just to
look at pictures. I must have told you - though I can't remember _
that D and I are going to the York-hall, as I suppose the MacSherry
are still at 615, and I hope they'll stay there all summer.

I'll probably write you one more lit 1 e 0.9 we sail. Don't
forget date and steamer — may 21, Kr n ri W lhelm. We ought to l
on the 28th. Of course I don't know whether or not you were planni
to meet us, or would be able to. But I'm going to say "Don't".
Every extra person only adds to poor Cousin T's confusion of mind,
we'll take the first train We can for New Haven. I'll telegraph yo
the minute we land.

I've had so much to trouble me recently, and I feel so piffliss, I
don't want any flaw in my homecoming. So if you love your Mim you'
be sure to have done the things I've made a point of your doing (c:
ing on the Bakers, and writing those letters) before I get there.

 

Goodnight and a million blessings on your dear head. My love to
Jde and to Wilson.
Your loving Mother.

Best Love
Your Rother.

Best Beloved —

I‘m on my way iome again,and this, I think, ends New}
for me till autumn. I think I never felt much loniier in my life
than Saturday night with the feeling that every minute was taking 3
farther aWay from me. And I know you felt with me the added woe
6f ehg 1©§5 of the game. Iate certainly rubbed it into us this tit

It was har to leave Cousin Theodore - he so hated to see me go. 1
