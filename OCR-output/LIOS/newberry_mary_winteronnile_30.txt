Tuesday, January 28. Harry came over early this morning (have I said that Tuesday is the weekly
holiday here?) and took Doris on an expedition to Kamak. Mr. Howard Carter came from his
diggings about eleven and stayed, politely quarreling with all of us, until time to escort Cousin

Emma and me to the Dahabya Cheops, just below us, where he and we were lunching with the
Fahnstocks.

Mr. Howard Carter merits a paragraph to himself. He is a young Englishman and one of the very
best diggers in Egypt. He used to dig for Cousin Theodore until they quarreled (n_ot politely, I
fear). Now he digs for lord Carnarvon. He can be perfectly chamiing, I'm told. This morning he
was probably liverish for he disagreed with everything that was said. Fleas were mentioned. He
said there were no ﬂeas in this part of Egypt! Cousin Emma then asserted that there were even
worse things than ﬂeas in this part of Egypt. He insisted on knowing what she meant. Goaded to
desperation she ﬁnally replied succinctly "Flesh-lice". "You can't acquire those", said he, "they
are parasites. The develop on the bodies of the persons who have them." "I've had them! ” said
the dainty little lady. "You can't have had them", asserted Mr. Carter. "Play ﬂigt piece!" he said,
pouncing on me as I was playing dominoes with Cousin T; it annoys me excessively to be watched
when I'm playing dominoes, and more so to be ordered about during the process. So I played
another piece and lost the game. "Why didn't you play the piece I told you to?" he demanded. (It
was the ﬁrst time I had ever talked to the man in my life.) "Because you told me to", I replied.
Whereupon he laughed and began to be pleasant. The luncheon with the Fahnstocks was very
agreeable, but with oceans too much to eat. I sat between an Italian Count.who is here buying up
lands to start a Franciscan or Dominican (I don't know which) monastery, and Mr. Tremaine (the
Contessa was at the other end of the table.) Mr. Tremaine is beginning to assume godlike

proportions in my mind since he told me that "one of his homes" is in Cornwall and that he owns a
magniﬁcent cliff near Tintagel. Think of owning a piece of that rapturous coast!

This evening Doris has, I'm happy to say, gone to dine with those lovely Piers at the Winter
Palace and to stay for the dance aﬁerwards.

Wednesday, Januagy 29. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings this morning and I
mended frantically until time to put on my very swagger serge (made by Hamilton & Co. of
Chapel St., and a credit to them) and go over to the Winter Palace to lunch with the Piers. The
little girls lunched with us - as I hoped they would - and each one of them gave me a lovely pink
rose. They looked like lovely pink roses themselves. Nothing on earth could be sweeter than they
are. We had a charming time, and then I got a carriage and drove Mrs. Pier out to the American
Mission School in which the Cousins have been so interested for years. Cousin T. always keeps
seven orphan girls there. As soon as any are graduated others take their place. There are three
American women teachers, a Scotch housekeeper and a number of native women teachers. The
chief diﬁiculty in the mechanism of the school is the feeding of the pupils - each meal has to be
served in three sections, according to caste, and with different food for each caste. It's a ﬁne new
building extending around a square court, and most of the rooms are light and airy. They, the
teachers, insisted upon our having tea with them and gave us some delicious Scotch Shortcake and
another kind of cake - quite the best I've had in Egypt. Then I came home and had another tea,
Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero being here for that function. He is surely one of the most delightﬁil
men in all the wide world. I fancy Lady M. is very agreeable when with people who canjabber
French but she will not exert herself in the least for those who move haltingly through the mazes
of the Gallic tongue. She allowed herself a moment of enthusiasm when we were hanging over
the rail watching the ducks, who know as well as anyone when it's teatime. "Comme il est
enorme, le gros!" was almost the only spontaneous remark I heard her make. In the middle of the
Masperos‘ visit a steam launch came pufﬁng and clattering up and a beautiful woman and her
