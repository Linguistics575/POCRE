Mr. R. observed that Radcliffe was not fond of Europe! "But he is
fond of his family" I said. "Oh! he likes his mother" said Mr.

R. ~ "but not me!" I never have been able to make Mr. R. out!

We saw Helen Walcott again, - she came to see us; and I had from Mr.

Walcott one of the most desperately pathetic letters I ever read.

The sense of Charlie's loss grows continually greater with me, and the
rose color has faded out of everything. One of the very first things
I meant to do on getting home was to go to see him, and it makes my
heart heavy to think that the utmost I can ever do now is to go and
put some flowers on his grave.

As in Italy so also here — we motor and motor and motor. It's for—
tunate that both D. and I are so fond of it. Here we have one of the
finest cars I've ever ridden in; — but it's always a limosine which
destroys some of the pleasure. Today we've been to St. Albans - a
magnificent cathedral, the largest, I'm told, in England, and built on
the site where the first martyrdom to Christianity took place in
England. As Cousin T. was waiting for us outside we didn't half see
it, but the drive there and back was lovely.

I got your letter, telling of your visit to Kim and that you thought
of going to Sonopah with Fred Brown, just before leaving Florence.
Would that I, too, might go to Sonopah.

TheeBakers seem to have been very kind about inviting you to meals.

I hope you have called spontaneously at least once. If not please

do it before we get home. I don't want my rapture at being with you
once again marred by finding you've been rude to people who have been
kind to you. Also it will be more in keeping with your self respect
to go by yourself than to be dragged there by the seat of your trou
by an irate Mim. Oh Dearest how good it will be to see you again!

God keep you safe.
Your loving Him.

Best Beloved - '_ Since my last letter I've been so unhappy I

just couldn't bring myself to write. It is nothing that has happened
to any of this party, and it's nothing that I feel like writing about;
though I'll tell you the whole story When I get home. 0 blessed word -
Home!_ But the thing has been so constantly in my mind that I've not
been able to enjoy anything.

I dined With Mrs. Bonbright the other evening at Claridges. She and
Er. B. live over here most of the time now, and have a place in the
country. They were staying in town for a few days preparatory to
sailing for America (Which they did on Saturday) for Howard's wedding!
He is marrying a Detroit girl named Elizabeth Hodges, and if she is as
lovely as her picture she must be a Queen indeed. We are invited to
tea on Wednesday to meet Norman Sturgis and his wife! - or rather
