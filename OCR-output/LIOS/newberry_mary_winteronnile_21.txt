Tuesday morning Cousin Emma and I went across in the felucca and paid Mr. Whymper a visit at
the Winter Palace and saw his last picture - a thing of beauty - birds on a sand bar, with all the
melted opal tints that we so oﬁen saw in the atmosphere as we came up the river from Cairo. He
also showed us a splendid study of a vulture, looking almost as noble as an eagle as he clasped a
lonely crag. "Close to the sun in lonely lands," I quoted, and Mr. Whymper, who is a very sudden
and enthusiastic person, almost clasped me = "l_\I_o! you don't know tlyit! How wonderﬁil! Dear
old Tennyson!" he shouted, and then together we bellowed the whole verse. From Whymper we
proceeded to call on the Contessa Contadone who, haply, was out. She came to tea yesterday
bringing a tired—looking young Englishman named Tremaine, whom she always has in tow, with
her. We found them here when we got back from Medinet Habu. What ruins those are - what
color and carving! Each place we go to seems more beautiﬁil and more incomprehensible than
the last. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I rode out to Der-el-Bahri. The start was
tumultuous and I almost gave up the expedition for the donkeys behaved so awfully. Even the
heretofore irreproachable Sugar was suddenly possessed of Satan. Doris vows that at one time all
three donkey boys and two of the crew were engaged in holding me on. It may be true.
Personally I never can remember details when a cyclone has struck me. But Der-el-Bahri with its
ruins of the mortuary temples of Queen Halshppsul and King Mentuhotep, with their entirely
different character from the other ruins we've seen, with their exquisite columns and Cloister
effects and the very beautiful view from their site high up on the base of the Libyan ranges, a view
over the desert, across the Nile and to Kamak beyond - all this was worth persevering for.

Saturday, January 4. This is coming to an abrupt close. I'm suffering tonight from an inexplicable
revulsion of feeling. I would rather - as I did - watch the row of kingﬁshers who practically live
on our cable and are too funny for words - than see the most beautiful temple in all Egypt. And I
would just as soon drop all my few jewels into the Nile as to read about Kamak or Luxor or the
Valley of the Tombs or anything in the world that's instructive. I'm very cross because I've got
neuralgia in my scalp - of all places - and I've torn my one and only decent hat to pieces and can't
get it together again, and you can't buy a hat this side of Cairo. So - well beloved fn'ends - I'll bid
you good-night - and in some happier frame of mind bid you good-morrow.

Your devoted
Mary

Dearest Adeline:- It's been a beautiful day - and anything more trite than that observation in this
land could not be invented. Have I said anything about the climate? It's the one, for winter, that
I've dreamed of all my life. You can count, with almost absolute certainty upon waking up every
day to sunshine. You can cook to your heart's content by sitting in it, or be as cool as you like by
moving into the shade. The one thing you have to be careful about is to always have a coat or
wrap within reach.

Doris and I, accompanied by Amelie (who is French Protestant) went to church this morning,
am'ving in ample time to admire the bougainvillia spreading its splendid blossoms all over the
white facade of the little chapel. That is, 1 had time to admire it - Doris dislikes it because of its
color. But I maintain that magenta suits the tropics. We were also in ample time to have our
tympanums cracked by the bell which a native was jangling with primitive enthusiasm. The rector
looks awﬁilly ill and races through the service at that breakneck speed that is so trying to my slow
