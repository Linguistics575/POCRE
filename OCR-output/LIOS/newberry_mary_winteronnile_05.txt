upper deck and very airy. The only trouble with it is that Teutonic taste in decoration has been
allowed to run riot. There are curious black Splotches in raised groups on the walls, which look
like symmetrical triplets of cockroaches, and occupying the place of honor is_ Venus nsmg from
the waves, all done in low relief in brass. Venus is knock—kneed and bumpy in outline, and the
builders, with probably unconscious humor, have put in a ﬁreplace beneath her. We've been
sliding along today with as little motion as though we were motonng on a perfect road.

W. The enchantment has begun. We awoke to a glorious day, with the
magic coast of Spain slipping by us. For the most part desolate and bare, it still looked so lovely
in the morning sunshine that even the lonely watchtowers scattered in a broken line high upon the
cliffs seemed desirable and romantic places of residence. At noon Algaciras - the white city of a
dream - drifted into view, and there suddenly before us was Gibraltar, splendid, smiling, grim.
The cousins have been here so often they no longer- care to go ashore, (though I can't imagine
living long enough to tire of it), so Doris and I went under the convoy of the peerless Jones. He
is certainly the most amazing man servant I ever heard of. To all his other innumerable abilities he
adds those of a ﬁrst class guide. On the dock there was the usual foreign babel, the only silent
thing being a huge and stately Moor who strode silently and indiﬁerently past everything and
everyone. Waiting beyond the wharf were dozens of little yellow carriages with canopy tops and
scant curtains - a cross between bird cages and sedan chairs - drawn by sturdy, nice little horses.
Into these vehicles everybody got and in a long line we scampered into the town. It looked
perfectly absurd. It's impossible for me to describe the striking beauty, the strangeness, the
fascination of that unique place, so arid and yet so tropical, - blank glaring stretches of wall and
sudden vivid little hanging gardens - morning glories, poinsettias, clematis, bougainvillias (can't
spell it): narrow and precipitous streets shut in between high walls - looking up them you see
gorgeous patches of blue sky, looking down - far, far below, - a sea with ships. Gay groups of
people, Spanish, English, red coats by the hundred, a ﬁne military band playing in the Parade, the
beautiﬁil Public Gardens with the Spanish cedars that give me a feeling of delight I cannot put into
words; and towering above all the grand summit of the Rock.

When we had driven up and up we took to our feet and, escorted by Tommy Atkins, we walked
up and up along a rock hewn path through a padlocked gate, which was careﬁilly locked behind
us, and into those wonderﬁil galleries honeycombing the Rock and made by General Eliott and his
men in those three besieged years. They show visitors only a very few of them. The only light
comes from the loopholes where the guns look out. And crouching to look out of one of these
loopholes down on that strange little narrow strip of sand - the Neutral Ground - one of the ship's
passengers standing near asked the silliest question I ever heard. The guns of Spain were facing
her; above, below, on either side, behind her, the mighty guns of England stood watching Spain.

"And what keeps it neutral ground?" said she. "What is there to prevent anyone's coming and
taking it? Is it a sort of spiritual compact?"

Doris and I would have liked to spend a week there, but we thanked high Heaven for even three
hours. And when we came back to the ship we watched the crowning beauties of the perfect day.
Back of Algeciras rose the full moon. A snowy white steamer lying near us, glittering with lights,
slid away into the Mediterranean, and as she went, from the crest of the Rock a ﬂame shot out, a
puﬁ‘ of smoke and the boom of a salute. Along the waterfront, the piers, the breakwater, long
lines of lights appeared and suddenly Gibraltar was sparkling as if with jewels. Then we were off
into the Mediterranean and as we rounded the point the lights of Gibraltar vanished, and there was

the superb, blank, desolate face of the Rock, cold and dark and mysterious in the moonlight, with
one ghostly little sail ﬂitting along the base.
