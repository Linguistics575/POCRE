West Bank, Luxor

Dearest Adeline;- Cousin Theodore and Doris are just back from the valley, having, like the
unreliable persons they are, stayed two days and nights when they said they would only be away
one. Doris is wild about the sarcophagus, and they both went into the tomb and saw it, though
Cousin Emma and I had given them cast iron orders not to, fearing it would cave in on them and
we miles away. The sarcophagus is of red granite, is 10 ﬂ. 3 in. long, 5ft. 3 in. wide, and 4 ft. 8
in. deep. It is covered with inscriptions and bears the cartouches of Siphtah. It is apparently in a
perfect state of preservation. The lid, which is lying beside it, face downward is 1 ft. 10 in. thick,
and evidently has a recumbent ﬁgure carved upon it. By lying on her tummy Doris managed to
see the two great feathers, part of a wig and one ear. Everyone of us is now agonizing for fear
the nose is broken. The sarcophagus is ﬁlled with debris and we don‘t yet know whether it
contains anything of value. A lot of broken alabaster objects have been unearthed in one comer
of the chamber, and Doris is the ostentatious owner of a small alabaster head with a lovely face
which she saw dug out. Isn't it gorgeous that we are here with things like that happening?

I was so anxious to hear their tidings (as well as needing exercise) that I started out on foot this
aﬁemoon hoping to meet them. Once in a while I do like to take a walk by myself, so I tried to
slip off without being seen. But the eagle eye of the ferocious second captain detected me, and in
three minutes I was being escorted by Sala, of the crew, with his heavy stick in his hand. We
ploughed through the sand till we reached the little path running through cultivated stretches, then
at right angles along the broader path which answers for a highway and is ankle deep in dust, and
where I had to sidestep donkeys laden with sugarcane and camels with mounted police; this for a
long distance till I came to a tiny mud village with an encircling wall, from the top of which a
yellow dog desired greatly to hurl himself on top of my hat, then under some ﬁne lebbek trees,
across a bridge an up on the embankment overlooking the vast plain where the Colossi sit forever
in state. There were hordes of people donkeying along (tourists mostly) but my party were
nowhere in sight so I turned around and came back again. I think white women never walk here,
except along the waterfront at Luxor, and if I'd been "a eﬁlant" or a rhinoceros I could hardly
have attracted more attention. It has been a grey day and I've resented it most unreasonably. One
really ought to be able to bear one grey day out of forty sunshiny ones, particularly when reading

the newspaper accounts of the frightful weather at home. I am so sorry and so concerned for you
all.

The Fahnstocks of New York and Newport have tied up in their Dahabya Cheops just to the rear
of us and their washing and ours have been ﬂapping on the sands in sweet accord all day.

Tuesday, January 14. Harry Burton came over from the valley early (Tuesday is his holiday) and
he and Doris and I crossed over to Luxor, they to wander among the beauties of Luxor and I to ‘
be prosaically shampooed. The morning was so gorgeous I hated to spend it that way. Harry
lunched with us on the Beduin and when he had, later, turned his donkey's nose toward the valley
and Cousin Theodore had arisen from his nap, the latter gentleman,

Doris and I rowed over to the Luxor landing, mounted our donkeys and started up the river - a
ride new to me, though the others had taken it once before. But we had barely started when
Sugar's conduct became unﬁt for print. He nearly threw me down an embankment, he brayed in a
manner that out-Juliused Julius, and I simply got off and refused ever to ride him again. The
others rode on and I descended the bank and sat in the felucca until they returned.
