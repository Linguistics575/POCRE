Tuesday, November 26. Just a word more. We are due in Naples tomorrow at the crude hour of
SIX and I've got the most part of my packing still to do and another long letter to write, and it's
evemng. The Mediterranean was perfectly lovely all day yesterday, and the coast of Africa
strange and haunting and majestic. There was snow upon the mountain tops. It was after dark
when we reached Algiers and Cousin Theodore wouldn't let Doris and me go ashore even with
Jones. "They're all of them beasts in that town“, he said shortly. So what we saw of Algiers was
from the deck, and the lights and the tiers upon tiers of dim white homes rising to the top of the
hill made a lovely effect. It's been choppy today and not quite so clear, but Sardinia has been with

us most of the time - looking easily the haunt of bandits. We are crazy to get to Naples. Two
days there and then we sail again on the 29th for Alexandria.

Our love to you and Augustus and to Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Blake, to whom this is to go next
and then to the dear Mitchells in Summerville, please.

Always your devoted
Mary

Saturday, November 30.
The Mediterranean.

Dearest Adeline:- It was perfectly glorious Wednesday morning when we arrived at Naples.
Bumping and banging and yelling began so early that even Doris the Dormouse was up and
exclaiming over Vesuvius at six. But our party, being a slow and stately one, were almost the last
to get off the steamer. The Grand Hotel had sent a special carriage for us, and away we drove,
unencumbered by anything except a small black bag with jewels, while Jones and Amelia looked
aﬁer the forty odd pieces of luggage. (It is really forty something in number.) As we drove
along, Doris and I beaming with delight suddenly held up by two leaping, shouting bandits, who
turned out to be Harry Burton, the delightful young Englishman who goes with us to Egypt, and
my dear Jim Whittaker, who had come all the way ﬁ‘om Florence (a twelve hour journey) just to
meet us. The Grand Hotel is a perfect place to stay, being directly on the bay with the most
heavenly views in all directions, and soldiers always drilling in the daytime, and wandering
rninstrels always singing by night in the street outside. Cousin Emma declined to drive that A.M.,
so Cousin T., Doris and Harry went off in one carriage and Jim and I in another, and climbed and
climbed among reddening vineyards and stone pines, and along the mountain road to Pasolippo
(don't know how it spells itself) with its gorgeous outlook. Jim and I got out and leaned on a
stone wall and watched in a ﬁeld, very far below us, twelve mounted buglers prancing about and
bugling, apparently to accustom their horses to the sounds, the really beautiﬁil sounds they made.
That aﬁemoon we all tea-ed at Bertolini's and when I stepped out on that terrace in the skies and
saw the kingdoms of the earth spread out before me I almost died of the beauty of it. Before
starting for Bertolini's, Jim, Doris and I had paid a visit to the Aquarium, which Mr. Agassiz used
to tell us was the ﬁnest in the world. It's small enough for one to see all the wonders without
getting tired to death. Never have I beheld anything as disgusting as the devilﬁsh. It did what the
Atlantic Ocean is powerless to do - it made me seasick. But I was revived by the antics of a crab
that did a skirt dance for our beneﬁt till we were in hysterics. That evening while the others were
playing cards, Jim and I went to the music room and he sang. If I were young he would have
sung the heart out of me. He's got a lovely voice with a quality in it that tears you to pieces.

Thursday. Thanksgiving Day, - with nothing to remind us of it except the many, many things we
have to be thankﬁil for, - was horrid, cloud and rain and mist blotting out everything. Jim and
Doris and I went to the Museum in the morning and stayed until Doris announced that she was so

3upper deck and very airy. The only trouble with it is that Teutonic taste in decoration has been
allowed to run riot. There are curious black Splotches in raised groups on the walls, which look
like symmetrical triplets of cockroaches, and occupying the place of honor is_ Venus nsmg from
the waves, all done in low relief in brass. Venus is knock—kneed and bumpy in outline, and the
builders, with probably unconscious humor, have put in a ﬁreplace beneath her. We've been
sliding along today with as little motion as though we were motonng on a perfect road.

W. The enchantment has begun. We awoke to a glorious day, with the
magic coast of Spain slipping by us. For the most part desolate and bare, it still looked so lovely
in the morning sunshine that even the lonely watchtowers scattered in a broken line high upon the
cliffs seemed desirable and romantic places of residence. At noon Algaciras - the white city of a
dream - drifted into view, and there suddenly before us was Gibraltar, splendid, smiling, grim.
The cousins have been here so often they no longer- care to go ashore, (though I can't imagine
living long enough to tire of it), so Doris and I went under the convoy of the peerless Jones. He
is certainly the most amazing man servant I ever heard of. To all his other innumerable abilities he
adds those of a ﬁrst class guide. On the dock there was the usual foreign babel, the only silent
thing being a huge and stately Moor who strode silently and indiﬁerently past everything and
everyone. Waiting beyond the wharf were dozens of little yellow carriages with canopy tops and
scant curtains - a cross between bird cages and sedan chairs - drawn by sturdy, nice little horses.
Into these vehicles everybody got and in a long line we scampered into the town. It looked
perfectly absurd. It's impossible for me to describe the striking beauty, the strangeness, the
fascination of that unique place, so arid and yet so tropical, - blank glaring stretches of wall and
sudden vivid little hanging gardens - morning glories, poinsettias, clematis, bougainvillias (can't
spell it): narrow and precipitous streets shut in between high walls - looking up them you see
gorgeous patches of blue sky, looking down - far, far below, - a sea with ships. Gay groups of
people, Spanish, English, red coats by the hundred, a ﬁne military band playing in the Parade, the
beautiﬁil Public Gardens with the Spanish cedars that give me a feeling of delight I cannot put into
words; and towering above all the grand summit of the Rock.

When we had driven up and up we took to our feet and, escorted by Tommy Atkins, we walked
up and up along a rock hewn path through a padlocked gate, which was careﬁilly locked behind
us, and into those wonderﬁil galleries honeycombing the Rock and made by General Eliott and his
men in those three besieged years. They show visitors only a very few of them. The only light
comes from the loopholes where the guns look out. And crouching to look out of one of these
loopholes down on that strange little narrow strip of sand - the Neutral Ground - one of the ship's
passengers standing near asked the silliest question I ever heard. The guns of Spain were facing
her; above, below, on either side, behind her, the mighty guns of England stood watching Spain.

"And what keeps it neutral ground?" said she. "What is there to prevent anyone's coming and
taking it? Is it a sort of spiritual compact?"

Doris and I would have liked to spend a week there, but we thanked high Heaven for even three
hours. And when we came back to the ship we watched the crowning beauties of the perfect day.
Back of Algeciras rose the full moon. A snowy white steamer lying near us, glittering with lights,
slid away into the Mediterranean, and as she went, from the crest of the Rock a ﬂame shot out, a
puﬁ‘ of smoke and the boom of a salute. Along the waterfront, the piers, the breakwater, long
lines of lights appeared and suddenly Gibraltar was sparkling as if with jewels. Then we were off
into the Mediterranean and as we rounded the point the lights of Gibraltar vanished, and there was

the superb, blank, desolate face of the Rock, cold and dark and mysterious in the moonlight, with
one ghostly little sail ﬂitting along the base.November 21 1912

Dearest Adeline:- We've just passed Flores in the Azores where Sir Richard Grenfell lay,

but in such thick weather that we only had misty glimpses of splendid crags towering up from the
water, their tops hidden in cloud, and one white village on a cape-like projection. We'll have to
go very close to the other Azores if we are to see them at all in this rain and fog laden
atmosphere. But at least it's smooth. Day before yesterday was our one very rough day - only 30
people, out of 200, at breakfast; I, of course, being one of the 30. But even I would have liked to
lie on my bed and howl all day with indeﬁnable and baseless misery. The Atlantic Ocean is the
one thing in all this wonderful world that could bore me to death. Even the luxuries with which

we are surrounded, and everybody kowtowing, from the Captain who looks like Santa Claus to
the least of the stewards, only slightly mitigates my mental ennui.

Yesterday in search of distraction I went to the "Beauty Parlor" and had everything I could think
of done to me, then went forth to shock my family with my new and fatal beauty. As a lurch of
the ship shot me into their midst in our salon (we have a salon of our own) I forestalled comment
by announcing loudly "My eyebrows are penciled and my lips rouged“. I was so amazed at the
comments of the masseuse when she was working over me. Through a slit in my eyelids I
observed her stealthily approaching with the eyebrow pencil, and demurred feebly "I never do that
sort of thing", to which she replied with gentle decision, "You should alvays - you are not haf
many eyebrow". I must say I was much pleased with my looks when she had ﬁnished, and am
beginning to understand how women become fools in their old age and take to making up.

One of my pleasures has been the daily reading of my precious missive, and I was so much
touched by the message from you and Augustus. I never knew you and he felt that way about me
- I thought th_at feeling was all on my side - so it's made me very happy. I meant to mail this at
Gibraltar but Cousin T. says it isn‘t safe to mail anything at Gibraltar as it sometimes takes months
for things to leave there. Doris is a great help and Cousin T. seems perfectly devoted to her -
even prefers her to me, I think. Isn't it lovely! Another dream come true.

Friday, November 22. I found that today's message was from Mr. Theodore Blake, with a plea
for "an occasional encyclical" so I‘m going to ask you to pass on all my letters to him and Mrs.
Blake. You see, you pampered darling, I mean to write frequently and ﬁJlly to you, so frequently
and fully that I very much doubt if any of my other New Haven friends get anything but postals
from me.

Last night at dinner the band played Dixie and a man sitting at a table near us, a man who looked
like a gentleman, suddenly gave the most appalling shout, and another and another. I never in my
life had heard the Rebel Yell, but I recognized it on the instant. Last winter in South Carolina I
said more than once, and really believed it, that I knew just how the Southerners felt and that they
had my ﬁill and understanding sympathy. But last night with that hideous sound in my ears I
suddenly saw red and there was murder in what I had humbly hoped was a tender'and a Christian
heart! It's really rather ghastly to abruptly discover how much of the savage is still leﬁ in one's
make-up.

After dinner, in the smoking room whither Doris and I always accompany Cousin T., we heard
people saying something about an island, and from the windows we saw one more Azore - a huge
black mass heaved up against an almost equally black sky, with here and there a light twinkling
near the water's edge. That smoking room is one of the nicest places in the ship to sit. It's on the

Ellen Mary Buttles was bom'on December 23, 1864 at Talmadge, Ohio. Her father, Levi Buttles
was a professor at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio. Her mother was Jennie Wright Buttles.
There were six children in the family, 4 boys and a two girls.

Her grandmother, Harriet Kilbourne Buttles, was the sister of Byron Kilboume, one of the
founders of Milwaukee.

When Mary was a child, a cousin of her mother's, Theodore Davis, a very wealthy lawyer, visited
in Gambier and was enchanted with her. Seeing that the family was very large and their ﬁnances
were limited, he asked if he could adopt Mary. His offer was refused, but my grandmother told
me that she went to her room and cried her eyes out because she thought she would be stuck in
Gambier forever and would never see the world!

Mary was married in Gambier in 1887 to Wolcott Ely Newberry of Cleveland. He was the son of
a well-known geologist and paleontologist, John Strong Newberry who was a professor at
Columbia. Wolcott was a graduate of the Columbia School of Mines and became manager of
various mines in Colorado and later in Equador. They lived in Aspen for several years in the early
1890's and in Colorado Springs for a few years after that. Then he went to Equador to manage
some mines there. Mary joined him there for six months. My grandfather became ill there and
they returned to New Haven where he died in 1898 at the age of 35. She never remarried.

I don't know how she managed to bring up her two children, Doris and Roger (my father). She
had very little money, but somehow she scrimped and saved and Was able to send them to private
schools and put my father most of the way through Yale by living in a boarding house in New
Haven in one room with my Aunt Doris, and when my father came home on vacations, she would
rent a room for him.

They used to go to Newport sometimes to visit Cousins Theodore and Emma Davis. One time
Cousin Theodore suggested that Mary should buy herself some new clothes - he was tired of
seeing the same dress on her. Whereupon she broke down and told him about her ﬁnancial
situation - and ﬁ'om then on he paid for my father's'education.

When my father came to Milwaukee to work for Bucyrus—En'e, his mother moved here also to
keep house for him. And she lived here from then on. When Cousin Theodore died in 1922 or
so, her inheritance made it possible to buy the ﬁrst house she ever‘owned, "Windfall" on the River
Road between the Schroeders and the Fullers. (which you may remember as the Squiers' house).
She had many, many ﬁiends all over the world. She was noted for her little Sunday supper patties.
She would prepare a chaﬁng dish which she served herself. She trained the cateress, Elsie
Possehl. Elsie's mother, Augusta Eisold, was her laundress and later became her cook, and Elsie's
brother Elmer was her chauffeur/gardener/general factotum.

With gas rationing it became necessary for her to move to town, and she lived in an apartment at
the Astor until she died in December 1945.Adeline and Augustus
