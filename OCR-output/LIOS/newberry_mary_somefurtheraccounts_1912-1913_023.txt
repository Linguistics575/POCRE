Best Beloved - As Doris wrote you early in the week I post—
poned my writing. We moved to this hotel Friday and were glad to get
away from the dahabya on account of the heat which was growmg too
great on the river. It's much cooler here. The rooms are perfectly
gigantic - truly palatial. There's a nice garden to walk or sit in.
But I have a confused feeling, - my room is so big I can't find any of
my things without hunting all over the place. I feel that we are
wasting opportunities here but we can't help ourselves. I've done only
two things worth doing since last Sunday. One of them Was the Torch-
light Tattoo Tuesday evening on Kasr e1 Nil Barracks Ground. It was a
very fine spectacle, — quite thrilling to see issuing forth from a-
great doorway two hundred Gordon Highlanders each carrying a torch.
They marched and evoluted in lines of light; and finally took their
stand outlining three sides of a tremendous hollow square in which all
the performances took place.

The other worth—While incident of the week was spending a couple of
hours in the museum Wednesday morning and seeing the wonders there in
the new light of my recently acquired learning in Egyptology. for the
rest I've gone to dressmakers and done errands, and taken little drives
to nowhere and played many games of dominoes. This morning Harry
Burton and I went to church While Doris staid on duty, and this after—
noon I staid while Doris and Harry went to the Zoo. They had a fascina-
ting time and saw many enchanting sights — baby lions and baby giraffes
and a hippo that came when it was called and opened and shut,.at the
bidding cf its keeper, the cavern it calls its mouth; and a baby ele—
phant marching at the head of a company of Scotch pipers; and they had
their tea on'a tiny island in a little lake where they were surrounded
by pelicnns and flamingoes. I

.Tomorrow we go to Sakkara on camels — a 16 mile ride in all. I'm doing
it out of pure bravado because Doris thinks I can't. "Mother you're
crazy! And Roger wouldn't allow it for a minute if he were here." But

you are not here, are you darling? Alas! that you are not! And I know
you like your mother to be a true sport. Harry and Doris and I and a
Lady Hilda something to Whom we have talked several times, and Who is
who is cutting all kinds of engagements tomorrow to go with us.

Goodnight my own dear boy. God bless you and keep you safe.

Your loving
Mother . h
