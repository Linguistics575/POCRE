was too shallow for the felucca to reach the shore. Before we knew where we were "at", Doris
and I had been lightly and skillﬁilly picked up, carried through the water and gently deposited in
the boat. One of the marked features of Asyut was that during our entire progress through it we
did not see a single white person, though there must be a number of English in residence. I
promise not to go on raving about sunsets - but tonight there was one, the beauty of which was
beyond anything I ever dreamed of; when I thought it was over and done with it had only just
begun. Egyptian sunsets will now be a part of what I mean when I say in the Gloria in Excelsis
"We thank Thee for Thy great glory."

Wednesday, December 18. I almost forgot to get dressed this morning in my absorption watching
the panorama on the eastern bank as I hung out of the window. They had all seemed to garb
themselves with an eye to symphonies. Two tan colored sheep were being driven by a man and a
boy in tan colored robes. A man shrouded in black was riding a black buﬁalo. Another black
buﬁ‘alo had a man in black tagging at his tail. A camel swung along with his rider clad in camel
color with a rose scarf around his neck - nothing could have been better.

Doris has made two astounding statements today. Possibly wearied by my oft-repeated
exclamations of wonder at the skill with which the women carry their water jars on their heads,
she announced she was sure she could do it herself. "Not full" said I. "Yes, ﬁill." "How far?"
"Oh, quite a distance." "You don't really think you could!" "Yes, I do." On being pinned down
relentlessly, she admitted that it might be wise for her to wear a bathing suit while doing it.
Statement No. 2 was when Cousin T. and I joined her on deck this morning and she announced
that a ﬂock of cranes numbering at least a thousand had ﬂown overhead. We couldn't make her
come down a single crane. Yesterday I saw a lovely ﬂight of snow-white ones, wheeling over a
sandbar and then settling on it.

The most spectacular thing on the shores today has been the stunning cliffs of the debel-el-
Harideh, with ancient quam'es and tombs, and - way up a gorge - an altar to a serpent with
miraculous healing powers. There is a yearly eight-day festival in honor of said snake, a festival
to which the Nile boatmen ﬂock. We've seen scores of shadufs working the last few days, but this
aftemoon we heard for the ﬁrst time the musical, lonely cry of the men who work them. Also as
our dahabya was passing one man, he strode down the bank, yanked off his one and only garment
and proceeded to wash it in the river. And the queer thing is you don't mind. Don't ask me why
this is so because I don't know why. We overhauled a dahabya this aﬁemoon ﬂying the English

ﬂag. Her name was Enterpe. As she was sailing unassisted by any tug, we easily ran away from
her. We have made seventy-two miles today.

Thursday, December 19. Today has been made up of sunshine (as always) delicious warmth,
enchanting sights on the shores, and birds innumerable. I myself counted sixty-two pelicans
sitting on one sandbar. We have three little birds of our own, wag-tails, that ﬂy along with us and
eat cake after tea till they spoil their ﬁgures and actually begin to waddle. We are tied up tonight
. near Nag Hamadi, and the Masperos are tied up on the other side of the river. They started two
days ahead us, but their boat is a heavy old thing.

F riday, December 20. We were late in leaving Nag Hamadi this morning because the tug had to
take on ﬁve tons of coal. Sixteen natives sat motionless. on the bank and watched me for half an

hour undoing a snarl in my knitting silk. It's their capacity for sitting motionless, I think, that has

earned them their reputation for laziness, for they certainly can worlg they are alert in their
movements and they never grow fat.
