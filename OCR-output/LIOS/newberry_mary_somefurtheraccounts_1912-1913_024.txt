Best Beloved — Jones has just informed me that unless I
get my letters off at 2:30 this afternoon they won't go for three
days. It is now 12:30 and luncheon in half an hour. So this must
be dashed off at a gallop. Oh my dear! that camel expedition on
Monday was the most wonderful thing I ever did. Of course_I was
horribly lame for 2 days afterwards, but so Were Harry and Doris. y.

would have adored it, — I'd have given anything to have had you alom

They weren't awfully good camels either, so I can imagine the raptuN
of riding fine ones. Harry Went off the other day On an expedition
with some English people one of whom was the Major of a Highland
regiment. Said Major furnished the camels from the coastguard corps

and Harry said they Were perfectlyfsuperb, and much much easier to n
than the ones we had.

We've haunted bazaars and done errands and had some swagger clothes
made (for which your uncle insisted on paying; - but we wouldn't hth
had them otherwise), and had visitors and gone to teas, and revelled
in street sights, and I've seen the Khedive and almost seen Lord
Kitchener but not quite, and have met one of the highest-up men in U
Army here - Major Watson, or Watson Pasha ~ whichever you choose to
call him, who is aide—de-camp to the Khedive. He is an enchanting
person and if he weren't already married I should try to get him for

Little Sister.

We are sailing Wednesday so my next letter will be from Naples where
going thence to Florence. No letter
Hope all goes well with you. Endless

we expect to spend two days,
from you since 2 weeks ago.'

Your Him

Best Beloved. We left Cairo yesterday morning at 9:u5 and reached'
Alexandria at one after a comfortable trip through such lovely scene;
I couldn't bear to take my eyes off the windows for a minute. We 7
sailed at 2:30 and are due in Naples at 11 A.M. Saturday. If we are?
not late and if the day is pleasant (it's funny I remembered to say g
that after four months of pleasant days as a matter of course) Harri
is going to take Doris - and me if I can get off L to Pompeii. And ;
Sunday Cousin T. is planning to take us on a marvellous motor trip a;
