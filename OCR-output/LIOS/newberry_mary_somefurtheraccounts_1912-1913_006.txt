people, but each and every craft carrying the lateen sail, so benutif
in its sweep even when its canvas is a crazy mass of tatters. u

We are almost criminally comfortable, and systematically over-fed _
would be if we ate all that was set before us. The Beduin draws onIOr
14 inches of water, and being tOWed, slides forward with such a totqi
absence of motion that if it were not for the scenery slipping by w; w
not know we were moving at all. There are 22 people on board just to
take care of us four. We tie up every night anywhere we happen to be
at sunset. The tying-up process is as f0110WS. We draw up to the
bank. One of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder and
worries it into the sane. Two of the crew carry huge wooden pins as b
as hitching posts, ashore and two more of the crew armed with mﬂllets
made of sections of tree trunk hammer the pins into the sand and we hr
tied to those. Jones is always armed in case we are lying near a nati
village that might be inclined to depredations.

We hope to reach Asyut tonight where there ought to be much mail aWait
ing Us, and where this will be posted. We do not expect to reach Luxo
till the let at the earliest. Goodbye for now my Darling. It‘s a
month today since we sailed and this is my nth letter to you besides
pst cards. I shall be very anxious to hear how you are after your lit
operation, so don't fail to carry out the instructions I sent you in m
last about having someone write me at once.
God bless my boy
With all my love
Your Mim

Dahabya Beduin -
On the Nile — tied up near

Nag Hamadi, Friday 20 Dec. 1912

Darling Gopher - Doris and I went ashore at Asyut, under the escori
of Hareem to take a drive through the city. The Beduin could not get
close to the shore so we were landed in the felucca with six Nubians
rowing it with a man~of—war's—men precision. We landed at the foot 01
steep, high bank done in rough masonry, and before I had time to Wonde
how on earth I was to climb it-I found myself at the top. ,A trusty
mariner at each elbow had wafted me thither. There's never the sligh1
fuss, - a nod, a single word from the person in command and the thing
done as if by magic. It was the same when we returned from our Asyut
spree. The Beduin and the felucca had moved up the stream to a spot‘
even the felucca couldn't make a landing. A word from Kareem and D.5
I were picked up deftly, carried through the water and set down gent”
into the boat. It Was market day in Asyut and the entire popu3
tion was apparently in the streets. We drove through the bazaar and‘
market where men, women, children, bulls, camels, donkeys were in one
grand mass. It is a large, important, rich tOWn, with many elaboratﬁ
houses belonging to natives, and during our entire drive we saw; not?
single white person. a

In spite of the delights in store for us I hate.to have this heavenll
voyage end. To all the enchantments of the shores have lately been i
added the most wonderful flocks of birds. The Sister-Kittie announc‘
yesterday when we joined her on deck that a flight-of at least 8

 

thousand cranes had passed overhead, and not all our efforts could we
