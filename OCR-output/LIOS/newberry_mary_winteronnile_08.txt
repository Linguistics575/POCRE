we landed there yesterday - it was so more than beautiful as we drew near it on - '

like rmles of ivory palaces ﬂoating on liquid lapis. As we sailed through the narrtdlfv se‘iiatraiidgiiictzd
the ﬁne harbor With _sh1pping from many and far distant lands all about us, and lovely square-
ngged sailing craft ndmg at anchor, and the Khedive's palace facing us, and beautiﬁil masses of
color on the wharf where men in fezes and turkish trousers and gold embroidery, men in turbans
and long straight robes of dark blue, pale blue, light yellow, orange, dull brown, soft green, white
black, moved and gesticulated and shouted - the voice of one of our compatriots said, pettishly ,
near us - Oh, this harbor is so glu_ll." I wonder why the gods permit people with scales upon their
eyes to travel. Through a scene of mad and wholly enchanting conﬁJsion we tore to the railroad
station in bumpy little carriages with drivers who shouted enthusiastically every step of the way.
Arrived, we took possession of two comfortable compartments reserved in loud red letters for
:‘Davrs Pasha", while Jones and Amelie did the work. They both speak Arabic, and Jones,
imperative but courteous, and Amelie, moving about like a battering-ram and hissing out vicious
syllables, accomplished the impossible. We were very late in getting oﬂ‘, but the glories of the
evening still make shivers run up and down my spine. Burning red spread half around the
horizon. On the right of us feathery pampas grass spread out in vast ﬁelds of the Cloth of Gold
edging a lake pale blue like Montana sapphires, and a ﬂight of ducks were silhouetted in black
against it. To the left of us cream colored walls with palm trees towering above them, tiny
villages of mud hovels, a ﬂeet of sails among the ﬁelds where an invisible canal was ﬂowing, tall
ﬁgures robed in white standing motionless to watch the train, the Flight into Egypt repeated again
and again on the high road, and towering over all the purple twilight (at last I've seen a purple
twilight) with Venus glittering on its edge.

We had expected to reach Cairo in time for dinner, but as it was we dined upon the train, and
Doris and I were glad, for never before had we had a meal where Persian powder was dashed in
splotches on the window panes to keep the ﬂeas outside. We were waited upon with cyclonic
ardor by two natives in snowy robes, red sashes and fezes. (There must be some other plural for
that, but I don't know it.) At the station in Cairo three or four of Cousin Theodore‘s native
servants were waiting to welcome us with kissing of hands and those touchings of the forehead
and the breast that somehow look so theatrical. At the hotel the manager met us at the. door and
conducted us at once to a gorgeous suite of rooms, while all our traveling companions were
waiting and writhing at the desk. All these ostentatious details I give you because it amuses me
clear through to my backbone that we, the denizens of that tiny apartment in Orange Street the
Despised, should be careering about the earth in Pomp and Circumstance.

This morning while standing on the terrace of Shepheard's waiting for our bright red motor car,
Doris and I were fallen upon by two old Colorado friends. Then we, escorted by Cousin
Theodore and Harry Burton, went to the Museum where we had one of the sensations of our lives
inspecting the wonders and the beauties of the Theodore M. Davis Room. Also we were taken
into the Holy of Holies and presented to Sir Gaston Maspero, who was most channing. He 15 fat
and chuckly and of a great simplicity and sweetness, and wholly delightﬁil. And he gave us each
(Doris and me) a grey and gold permit "de visiter jusqu' du 30 Juin, 1913, tous les monuments
fermes en enclos de la Haute—Egypte“ - besides, of course, the freedom of the Museum.

After luncheon, while the Elders were napping, Harry and Doris and I escaped and did the bazaars
on foot and saw more queer things in an hour than in most of our lives put together before. "The
crowded streets of the bazaar" - every chronicler says that, but henceforth it will call up to my
mental vision a vivid picture instead of the vague impression of old. We were a little frowned on
when we returned, and it was suggested that we were probably packed with ﬂeas or worse; but
we were given the beneﬁt of the doubt and were then swept off to see the Pyramids. It was a
