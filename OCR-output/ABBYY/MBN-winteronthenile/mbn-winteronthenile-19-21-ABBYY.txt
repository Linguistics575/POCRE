than we are of ours. About eleven Doris and I mounted our gallant donkeys and with Malimond and Nobi running beside us we were off for the Colossi of Memnon. Over the sands winding among deep hollows where the Nile water is still undried, along a path beaten hard by the feet of women bearing water jars, between garden patches, along deep cuts, jumping little ditches, and finally straight on towards those glaring mountains that make me catch my breath with delight whenever I look at them - over a dusty road with a cane field on the left and a train of fifty camels waiting to be loaded; and on the right a field presumably meant to be of winter wheat but really of crested larks filling the air with their sweet notes. The crested larks and camels absolutely ignored the Colossi of Memnon and when we got close to them and found we didn't reach, even on the backs of our chargers, to the tops of their big toes we wished that we too might feel a fine crested camelian indifference. Truly, I sometimes get worn out with emotions in this land of mighty marvels. We rode on a little beyond the Colossi towards Medinet Habu, and an Arab who had never entered my life before held me up to beg me to take some scarabs back to the Beduin to show Mr. Davis! "They are real, madam, as you see if only you look". "I do not know", I said fiercely, "the difference between real scarabs and imitation ones, so it's not worth while my looking". We rode back in a fierce high noon and the air was simply heavenly. As we galloped around the comer of a mud wall we almost collided with Mr. Crane and Mr. Carter on their way out to their diggings. They looked almost like a parade, their donkeys were so trapped out in red tassels. In the afternoon I went over to Luxor with the usual retinue of seven of the crew and Jones. One of the minor delights of this heavenly time I'm having is the being waited on hand and foot as if I were a Princess.
I went to Luxor then to leave cards on some people at the Winter Palace and to do an errand or two. I promised you some time ago that I would not go on raving about sunsets. We've had them regularly every night, and with the rectitude of a lofty spirit I've kept silent about them. But you'll have to let me state the bare facts that coming back to the Beduin from Luxor this evening we were rowing into a brilliant orange that merged into rose color that throbbed up to the feet of the Evening Star, while from the horizon flared great streamers of pale green. Far down the river behind us the sky and the water and the very air were of the blue a sapphire would be if opaque, with snow white sails and creamy walls of houses and flashing lights gleaming against it. And our right hand oars dipped into melted amethyst and our left into liquid turquoise.
I must stop now. If I write another sheet to this letter full well I know none of you would have the patience to read it. "Kulle sana w'inta taiyib" to you all. With oceans of love from

West Bank-Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- It's a whole week since I've written, so this letter will be reminiscent instead of journalistic like the others. A week ago today we went out to the valley and stayed three days, and though in some ways it reminded me of my mining life, in others it was a unique experience. The House in the Valley is seven miles from the Beduin on the west bank. Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones rode. I meant to ride but at the last moment found Cousin Emma didn't want to drive alone, so I drove with her in a sort of surrey thing drawn by two black mules and driven by a bandit in baggy white trousers. First across the sands straight towards the mountains, then at right angles along a ticklish shelving road on the edge of a very deep cut, then a sharp turn towards the mountains again, through a tiny biblical village with palm trees and a well, out again in a minute into the glare of the desert, and then on a hard white limestone road up to the mountains and into the mouth of the valley. And there my breath left me - for it was like the

wreck of a world. On and on we drove through towering cliffs and amid a titanic chaos of broken flints and splintered rock and fossil shells, with not even the memory of a green growing thing for miles upon miles. And then we came to a fork in the valley with a jutting ridge, a mighty one between, and to the left goes the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings and to the right the West Valley where Cousin Theodore's house is. It is a long, low and plastered structure with a flat roof, like thousands in Mexico. The dining room is at the front end and the sitting room at the far end, and between the two runs a hall with four anchorites' cells for bedrooms opening off it. Rough cement floors, rough plastered walls with little slits of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick walls.
When we drew up in front of this residence slaves dashed out and kissed our hands and did our boots with a feather duster. The rest of the party were hot on our heels. Julius Caesar (Cousin Theodore's donkey - and a perfect devil) braying his head off. He so loves the sound of his own voice that he brays all the time. Then we entered and took possession, Harry Burton doing the honors. As Cousin Theodore's Manager of Excavations he lives in the House in the Valley. He'd given up his room to me. "It may smell of disinfectant, but it's all right - it doesn't mean anything except that the last chap died here, you know", he explained. A short time before we arrived they had killed a five foot snake by the great water jars in the shed near the front door, and Doris found a deceased mouse in her wash basin. So I felt rather squeamish when I entered my cell after dark and wondered what I might possibly touch before I got the candles lighted; therefore when the whole box of matches flared off at once in my hand I most naturally shrieked. The nights were wonderful, the stars blazed so close you could almost pick them from the velvet sky, the silence surpassed anything I've ever known - no faintest shadow of a sound except when a sudden gust of wind swept past, and was utterly gone, like the moan of a wild beast. And all night long a guard with a rifle stood at the front comer of the house to ward off any wandering —sons of the desert who might drop into the valley by the jackal trails leading over the cliffs.
The next morning we had a sort of royal progress into the valley of the Tombs - Cousin Theodore on the vociferating Julius, Cousin Emma in a carrying chair with two bearers, Doris and Jones and I on foot. That morning was one of the sensations of Doris's and my lives, but I won't bore you with descriptions, for is it not all written in the Books of Belzoni, Weigall, Budge, Dans, Petrie and others? Aside from all the wonder and beauty and impressiveness that we saw there was the fun of sailing by groups of staring tourists into a place labeled largely "No Admittance" and entering the tomb of Siphtah where Cousin T. is doing the only excavating at present going on in the valley. It was very dusty and very dark except in flashes where the light was thrown in by a mirror at the mouth. And a procession of children were carrying out the debris in baskets. The thing I hate in this country is the way they work the children. At Kamak overseers stand by with long-lashed whips, but our overseer is not permitted a whip. That afternoon I took a walk by myself, climbing a ridge and going down into a third valley and up another ridge. The sun had set and the silence was dreadful, and suddenly a horror of the desert (quite different from ordinary fear) seized me and I fled back to the house, where I was seriously taken to task for wandering about by myself. Sunday afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I made an expedition up our own west valley, and anything more superb, austere and overpowering I think I've never seen. Two or three of the Kings elected to be buried there, and I wonder all of them didn't; it's so much more spectacular and imperial than the other valley.
Monday morning immediately after breakfast Cousin Emma and I departed, the others reluctantly promising to follow the next day. And wasn't it good to get back to the Beduin and bath tubs and clean clothes, and the haunting river with its palm trees and gardens on the Luxor side, and the desert all the more beautiful for being retired to the background.

Tuesday morning Cousin Emma and I went across in the felucca and paid Mr. Whymper a visit at the Winter Palace and saw his last picture - a thing of beauty - birds on a sand bar, with all the melted opal tints that we so often saw in the atmosphere as we came up the river from Cairo. He also showed us a splendid study of a vulture, looking almost as noble as an eagle as he clasped a lonely crag. "Close to the sun in lonely lands," I quoted, and Mr. Whymper, who is a very sudden and enthusiastic person, almost clasped me - "No! you don't know that! How wonderful! Dear old Tennyson!" he shouted, and then together we bellowed the whole verse. From Whymper we proceeded to call on the Contessa Contadone who, haply, was out. She came to tea yesterday bringing a tired-looking young Englishman named Tremaine, whom she always has in tow, with her. We found them here when we got back from Medinet Habu. What ruins those are - what color and carving! Each place we go to seems more beautiful and more incomprehensible than the last. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I rode out to Der-el-Bahri. The start was tumultuous and I almost gave up the expedition for the donkeys behaved so awfully. Even the heretofore irreproachable Sugar was suddenly possessed of Satan. Doris vows that at one time all three donkey boys and two of the crew were engaged in holding me on. It may be true.
Personally I never can remember details when a cyclone has struck me. But Der-el-Bahri with its ruins of the mortuary temples of Queen Halshppsul and King Mentuhotep, with their entirely different character from the other ruins we've seen, with their exquisite columns and cloister effects and the very beautiful view from their site high up on the base of the Libyan ranges, a view over the desert, across the Nile and to Kamak beyond - all this was worth persevering for.
Saturday. January 4. This is coming to an abrupt close. I'm suffering tonight from an inexplicable revulsion of feeling. I would rather - as I did - watch the row of kingfishers who practically live on our cable and are too funny for words - than see the most beautiful temple in all Egypt. And I would just as soon drop all my few jewels into the Nile as to read about Kamak or Luxor or the Valley of the Tombs or anything in the world that's instructive. I'm very cross because I've got neuralgia in my scalp - of all places - and I've torn my one and only decent hat to pieces and can’t get it together again, and you can't buy a hat this side of Cairo. So - well beloved friends - I'll bid you good-night - and in some happier frame of mind bid you good-morrow.
Your devoted

Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- It's been a beautiful day - and anything more trite than that observation in this land could not be invented. Have I said anything about the climate? It's the one, for winter, that I've dreamed of all my life. You can count, with almost absolute certainty upon waking up every day to sunshine. You can cook to your heart's content by sitting in it, or be as cool as you like by moving into the shade. The one thing you have to be careful about is to always have a coat or wrap within reach.
Doris and I, accompanied by Amelie (who is French Protestant) went to church this morning, arriving in ample time to admire the bougainvillia spreading its splendid blossoms all over the white facade of the little chapel. That is, I had time to admire it - Doris dislikes it because of its color. But I maintain that magenta suits the tropics. We were also in ample time to have our tympanums cracked by the bell which a native was jangling with primitive enthusiasm. The rector looks awfully ill and races through the service at that breakneck speed that is so trying to my slow
