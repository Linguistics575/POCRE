Friday. December 13. This is a land of pure delight. I've spent the entire day, practically, on deck, absorbed in watching shores Cousin Theodore pronounces "dull". The first thing we saw after breakfast (we started about an hour before we were up) was that strange monument the Arabs call the "false pyramid" - the Pyramid of Meidum, built in three concentric towers, the central one the highest. To me it's much more impressive than the other pyramids. The scenery today has been less spectacular than yesterday, but everything is so fascinating and there is no stretch so desolate but that you see some human figures, these splendid figures in their always artistic robes - not blue as in Cairo where nine-tenths of the natives wear the most heavenly shades of blue, but in sharp contrast of black and white. Sometimes it will be a solitary figure seated brooding by the Nile, far from any habitation, or a group of women filling their water jars at the river, men working at a shaduf or, most delightful of all to me, a frieze-like effect against the sky (when the road runs along the top of a high embankment) or a camel loaded so with cane that you can only see his legs, a woman with a water jar upon her head, a donkey ambling along with a shrouded Arab sitting on his tail (almost), a camel with a rider swaying on his back, -1 never in a thousand years could get tired of it. The strangest village we have seen today we did not at first recognize as a village - it so melted into the hills behind it, as bare and desolate as they - the whole scene made up of burning sand, glaring rocks and sun-baked mud, except, clear down in the foreground by the river, a tiny square of emerald grass with three lovely trees. Presently we came to the most fascinating sight of the afternoon - on a point at a bend in the river, and surrounded by palms, the cream colored Coptic Convent of Mar Antonios, with a splendid tree top springing up through the roof. Back of the convent starts a caravan route to the Red Sea.
Just before the luminous dusk began to steal about us we slipped past an estate with a villa of importance and many outhouses and all the air of belonging to Someone-in Particular - perhaps to "Our Mother of the Khedive" as the dragoman say. And from beneath the giant palms three camels arose at the bidding of an Arab and slipped down to the river to fill up their fifteen stomachs.
Saturday. December 14. And Doris' birthday. We have passed through scenes today considered uninteresting by those who have been up the river twenty-two and down it twenty two. But Doris and I loved every foot of it. About the middle of the afternoon we tied up to an island in order that the tug might coal at Shekh-Fadl, a town with a huge sugar factory close by on the mainland.
Doris and I immediately took to the island for a walk, with one of the crew as bodyguard. I privately scouted the idea of the necessity when we started out but changed my mind before our return. An Arab of your own carrying a stout stick is a comforting appendage when you meet other Arabs in lonely stretches. Our island had no houses, but it did have numerous vegetable gardens. It was much larger than we thought when we first undertook to walk around it.
Walking in the powdery sand along the shore was tiring, and then I proved that between persons of intelligence community of language is not necessary. "Why", said I to our Arab, who knows not a word of English, "can't we cross over here to the boat?" "Because", said he in Arabic, of which I know only the one word "Kaddah" (liar), "we may not walk through the standing crop."
Sunday. December 15.- and the first warm morning that we've had. We have passed close to the base of giant limestone cliffs where hordes of white-robed men were quarrying and tumbling great pieces of gleaming rock down to the water's edge. The sunshine on the scene made a blinding glare, but it was very beautiful; and then came the splendid Gehelet-Ter ("Bird Mountain") rising sheer from the water, and on its summit the Convent of Der el Adra ("Our Lady Mary the Virgin"). It is also called the Convent of the Pulley, because visitors used to be hauled up by that device. Now there are steps cut in the rock, and as we looked there came bounding down them with incredible speed a woman with a water jar on her head. Today we have seen for the first time those long, long stretches of brilliant green close to the river's edge, which in my childhood I
10
imagined bordered the Nile on both sides of its entire length. Also we've had clouds and two or three dashes of rain and strong winds that have blown the sand till the air has been full of a foglike mist.
And now I really must write to my mother and my son and a few other persons who will stop loving me if I don't. This will be posted at Asyut tomorrow, and unless something particularly interesting happens I shall add no more to this edition. Except always my faithful love to my dear DuBois, Blake and Mitchell friends.

Tuesday. December 17.
The Beduin on the Nile, somewhere near Abutig and about 260 miles south of Cairo.
Dearest Adeline:- I'm not going to treat you to the best writing paper every time. If I used it all up on my personal correspondence I might cease to be persona grata on the Beduin. But this is the Royal Cambrian Writing Pad, which sounds as though it ought to suit the most exacting.
We did not get to Asyut until one today, but our last hour of daylight yesterday was one never to be forgotten. For at least an hour we were skimming past the base of giant cliffs rising sheer from the river - the wonderful Gebel Abu Feda. Really cafe-au-lait in color they were glowing with tints of unearthly beauty caught from the orange and rose sunset going on across the river. Their jagged summits cut into a sky of such ecstatic blue that it made my throat contract, (perfect color does that to me.) And high above the mast rode a silver half moon. Never before have I seen a really silver moon.
We reached Asyut at luncheon time. Doris and I bolted that meal in haste and went ashore with Haneen as bodyguard, to take a drive through the town. We had to land in the felucca, and it was very pleasant being rowed by six Arabs handling their oars with a man-of-war's precision. We drew up at the bottom of a steep bank done in rough masonry and by means of a mariner at each elbow and my own active strides I was wafted to the top like a withered leaf. (It is my regard for the Eternal Fitness of Things that made me say withered leaf instead of lotus flower, as I wanted to.) In a rickety victoria with a woolly yellow mat seething with fleas under our feet, and Haneen perched beside the driver, who wore his turban at a rakish angle acquired only by the few, and who shouted every foot of the way to clear the road, we proceeded through the bazaar and the market. The bazaar was like Cairo, only not nearly so interesting, but the market (it was market day) was more than worth seeing. A mass of people, bulls, camels, donkeys in a dust trodden space with walls on three sides and the fourth open to heavenly green fields, and an imposing mountain in the background with an ancient burying ground and the ruins of the old city at its foot.
Asyut is a prosperous and wealthy town, with many pretentious houses owned by rich natives, and some charming bungalows evidently inhabited by English people. The one other flaw, besides the yellow mat, to our expedition was the way the driver lashed the horses. "Haneen, make him stop whipping his horses." A word from Haneen which took effect for a minute and a half. "Haneen, tell him not to beat his horses." A minute of respite. "Haneen. it displeases me to have the horses beaten. Make him stop." Fierce remarks in the vernacular from Haneen, five minutes peace, then the wallopings were resumed and I gave up. You might have an apoplexy or burst a blood vessel trying to prevent it, and all in vain. The Beduin had moved up stream and the water
11
was too shallow for the felucca to reach the shore. Before we knew where we were "at", Doris and I had been lightly and skillfully picked up, carried through the water and gently deposited in the boat. One of the marked features of Asyut was that during our entire progress through it we did not see a single white person, though there must be a number of English in residence. I promise not to go on raving about sunsets - but tonight there was one, the beauty of which was beyond anything I ever dreamed of; when I thought it was over and done with it had only just begun. Egyptian sunsets will now be a part of what I mean when I say in the Gloria in Excelsis "We thank Thee for Thy great glory."
Wednesday. December 18. I almost forgot to get dressed this morning in my absorption watching the panorama on the eastern bank as I hung out of the window. They had all seemed to garb themselves with an eye to symphonies. Two tan colored sheep were being driven by a man and a boy in tan colored robes. A man shrouded in black was riding a black buffalo. Another black buffalo had a man in black tagging at his tail. A camel swung along with his rider clad in camel color with a rose scarf around his neck - nothing could have been better.
Doris has made two astounding statements today. Possibly wearied by my oft-repeated exclamations of wonder at the skill with which the women carry their water jars on their heads, she announced she was sure she could do it herself. "Not full" said I. "Yes, full." "How far?" "Oh, quite a distance." "You don't really think you could!" "Yes, I do." On being pinned down relentlessly, she admitted that it might be wise for her to wear a bathing suit while doing it. Statement No. 2 was when Cousin T. and I joined her on deck this morning and she announced that a flock of cranes numbering at least a thousand had flown overhead. We couldn't make her come down a single crane. Yesterday I saw a lovely flight of snow-white ones, wheeling over a sandbar and then settling on it.
The most spectacular thing on the shores today has been the stunning cliffs of the debel-el-Harideh, with ancient quarries and tombs, and - way up a gorge - an altar to a serpent with miraculous healing powers. There is a yearly eight-day festival in honor of said snake, a festival to which the Nile boatmen flock. We've seen scores of shadufs working the last few days, but this afternoon we heard for the first time the musical, lonely cry of the men who work them. Also as our dahabya was passing one man, he strode down the bank, yanked off his one and only garment and proceeded to wash it in the river. And the queer thing is you don't mind. Don't ask me why this is so because I don't know why. We overhauled a dahabya this afternoon flying the English flag. Her name was Enterpe. As she was sailing unassisted by any tug, we easily ran away from her. We have made seventy-two miles today.
Thursday. December 19. Today has been made up of sunshine (as always) delicious warmth, enchanting sights on the shores, and birds innumerable. I myself counted sixty-two pelicans sitting on one sandbar. We have three little birds of our own, wag-tails, that fly along with us and eat cake after tea till they spoil their figures and actually begin to waddle. We are tied up tonight near Nag Hamadi, and the Masperos are tied up on the other side of the river. They started two days ahead us, but their boat is a heavy old thing.
Friday. December 20. We were late in leaving Nag Hamadi this morning because the tug had to take on five tons of coal. Sixteen natives sat motionless on the bank and watched me for half an hour undoing a snarl in my knitting silk. It's their capacity for sitting motionless, I think, that has earned them their reputation for laziness, for they certainly can work, they are alert in their movements and they never grow fat.
