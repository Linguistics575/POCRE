tired she was beginning to hate everything. We all thought it was worth journeying to Naples simply to see that bronze "Hermes Resting", found at Herculaneum.
Yesterday, another very beautiful day, we sailed, officially at noon but really not till two. The delay was caused by a tragedy. A poor sailor or stevedore was killed when some cargo was being lowered into the hold, and we had to wait until the city authorities would let us go. Doris and Harry Burton and I stood long on deck as we moved out of that superb harbor, and when we had sailed past Capri all the perfect beauty of the unparalleled coast unrolled before us, its many cities and hamlets lying white in the shadow and pink in the sunlight. We were almost certain we could pick out the spot where
"Sits Amalfi in the heat Bathing ever her white feet In the tideless summer seas.
If only we can take that drive when we come back!
We passed Stromboli near midnight, but it was sleeping so there was nothing to see but a huge black cone rising out of the sea. And we were sleeping when we threaded the Straits of Messina.
We are very comfortable on this steamer, though not as luxurious as on the Berlin. All these German boats feed you to death. You could stuff till you burst if you were so "dispoged". There is everything on the menus to which the plain American has been accustomed from infancy (including "corned beef hache Americaine") as well as everything you never heard of from "Spitcake" to "Lobskaus with dilled cucumber".
Sunday. December 1.
And a mighty indolence is upon me, body and mind. My spectacles are broken and I can't see to read Baedecker's Egypt, and rejoice that I can't.
There was a sunset last night that steeped our very souls in color. It filled the heavens, glittering gold in the west and mother-of-pearl in the east, while liquid opal shifted and vanished on the sea. Today it has been a calm sea and delicious warmth and a far dim glimpse of Crete. Tomorrow it ought to be Alexandria about noon and Cairo in time for dinner. And I hope that when we reach Cairo Doris and I will be able to remember that we are puffick ladies and keep from shrieking with delight.
The moment we reached the hotel at Naples I posted 24 letters and notes I had written on the steamer, and Heaven send that they all reach their various destinations. You - all of you who read this - ought to have heard from me before this reaches you.
Dear love from your ever devoted

Shepheard's Hotel Cairo
Oh, Adeline, and Oh, Augustus, and Oh, All You Other Dear People who read this letter -1 simply love this land to death! Why did I say that Algeciras was "the white city of a dream"? Because I would so much rather have said it about Alexandria! It was so perfectly heavenly when

we landed there yesterday - it was so more than beautiful as we drew near it on the sea - it looked like miles of ivory palaces floating on liquid lapis. As we sailed through the narrow entrance into the fine harbor with shipping from many and far distant lands all about us, and lovely square-rigged sailing craft riding at anchor, and the Khedive's palace facing us, and beautiful masses of color on the wharf where men in fezes and turkish trousers and gold embroidery, men in turbans and long straight robes of dark blue, pale blue, light yellow, orange, dull brown, soft green, white, black, moved and gesticulated and shouted - the voice of one of our compatriots said, pettishly, near us - Oh, this harbor is so dull." I wonder why the gods permit people with scales upon their eyes to travel. Through a scene of mad and wholly enchanting confusion we tore to the railroad station in bumpy little carriages with drivers who shouted enthusiastically every step of the way. Arrived, we took possession of two comfortable compartments reserved in loud red letters for "Davis Pasha", while Jones and Amelie did the work. They both speak Arabic, and Jones, imperative but courteous, and Amelie, moving about like a battering-ram and hissing out vicious syllables, accomplished the impossible. We were very late in getting off, but the glories of the evening still make shivers run up and down my spine. Burning red spread half around the horizon. On the right of us feathery pampas grass spread out in vast fields of the Cloth of Gold edging a lake pale blue like Montana sapphires, and a flight of ducks were silhouetted in black against it. To the left of us cream colored walls with palm trees towering above them, tiny villages of mud hovels, a fleet of sails among the fields where an invisible canal was flowing, tall figures robed in white standing motionless to watch the train, the Flight into Egypt repeated again and again on the high road, and towering over all the purple twilight (at last I've seen a purple twilight) with Venus glittering on its edge.
We had expected to reach Cairo in time for dinner, but as it was we dined upon the train, and Doris and I were glad, for never before had we had a meal where Persian powder was dashed in splotches on the window panes to keep the fleas outside. We were waited upon with cyclonic ardor by two natives in snowy robes, red sashes and fezes. (There must be some other plural for that, but I don't know it.) At the station in Cairo three or four of Cousin Theodore's native servants were waiting to welcome us with kissing of hands and those touchings of the forehead and the breast that somehow look so theatrical. At the hotel the manager met us at the door and conducted us at once to a gorgeous suite of rooms, while all our traveling companions were waiting and writhing at the desk. All these ostentatious details I give you because it amuses me clear through to my backbone that we, the denizens of that tiny apartment in Orange Street the Despised, should be careering about the earth in Pomp and Circumstance.
This morning while standing on the terrace of Shepheard's waiting for our bright red motor car, Doris and I were fallen upon by two old Colorado friends. Then we, escorted by Cousin Theodore and Harry Burton, went to the Museum where we had one of the sensations of our lives inspecting the wonders and the beauties of the Theodore M. Davis Room. Also we were taken into the Holy of Holies and presented to Sir Gaston Maspero, who was most charming. He is fat and chuckly and of a great simplicity and sweetness, and wholly delightful. And he gave us each (Doris and me) a grey and gold permit "de visiter jusqu' du 30 Juin, 1913, tous les monuments fermes en enclos de la Haute-Egypte" - besides, of course, the freedom of the Museum.
After luncheon, while the Elders were napping, Harry and Doris and I escaped and did the bazaars on foot and saw more queer things in an hour than in most of our lives put together before. "The crowded streets of the bazaar" - every chronicler says that, but henceforth it will call up to my mental vision a vivid picture instead of the vague impression of old. We were a little frowned on when we returned, and it was suggested that we were probably packed with fleas or worse; but we were given the benefit of the doubt and were then swept off to see the Pyramids. It was a

grey afternoon (we've not yet seen the sun in Cairo). And perhaps it was the absence of the fierce blue background that disappointed me at first. But when we had teaed at the Mena House and started home along that wonderful road with its endless procession of startling figures of men and beasts and veiled women (I had an uncanny feeling that we were driving through the Old Testament in a motor car) - we had only to turn our heads a little to see those strange and splendid monuments against the blood red sky of the sunset.
Wednesday. December 4. Another grey day, but it doesn't matter in the least. Why should it, in a land where everything is a thousand times more enchanting even than you expected it to be? I had to stay in the hotel this morning doing dull but necessary things while the others went off and amused themselves. But this afternoon we motored out through that extraordinary new suburb Heliopolis, the perpetration of a German Syndicate drunk with power - and out into the desert until it was easy to believe that there was nothing in all the world but wide wastes and ridges and deep hollows of grey and shifting sands. We stopped on our homeward way for tea at the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, and watched people of various nationalities from those who spoke an unknown tongue to nice Englishmen with darling dogs. The cousins have seen all the wonders of this land for so many years that they "cannot", as Doris told Artin Pasha this afternoon - "cannot understand why we are so wild with excitement whenever we see a camel." (Indeed Doris riding a camel in Cairo would be much less conspicuous that she is on a horse in New Haven.) Artin Pasha, an Armenian archaeologist of distinction, and Prof. Sayce, Oxford Don, scientist of great renown, called this afternoon and talked delightfully. Artin Pasha wore his fez all the time, and I have to confess looked the "unspeakable Turk", blear-eyed and with a rather dreadful nose, and the Oxford Don wore a collar of prehistoric vintage, light brown socks and chopped-off Congress gaiters of black.
Thursday. December 5. Today Cairo has basked in sunlight, but it's been a "white day", the sky lacking the deep Egyptian blue and the air somewhat hazy. We went to the Zoo, which was enchanting, visited the Beduin - our dahabeah - and I wish everybody I know and care for could see it. It's a beauty. Jones and Amelie, and the crew and native servants (20 in number) were all engaged in getting things spick and span. A small flock of ducks came paddling frantically up when whistled for and gobbled the bread I threw them. We are to move on board Monday and start early Tuesday morning. This afternoon we went to the Citadel and entered that wonderful mosque of Mohammed Ali, the minarets of which are so ethereal, so exquisite, you almost fear they will vanish as you watch them. We did not have to put off our shoes from off our feet, but we had to slip huge yellow slippers over them.
Things go on being as deliciously strange as ever; a man sits on a bench in the Zoo and is shaved by an itinerant barber; a tall athletic figure clad in a heavenly blue garment strides across the street with three dried crocodiles under his arm, and no one but 615 Orange Street even turns to look at him. Every time we emerge upon the terrace of Shepheard's, fakirs with monkeys, cobras and mongooses meet our enraptured gaze, and the riot of color satisfies even my color loving soul.
