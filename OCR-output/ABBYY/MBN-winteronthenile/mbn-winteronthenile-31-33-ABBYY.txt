good-looking husband asked for me. They were Mr. and Mrs. Packard - she a niece of Mrs. William Famam, and very like her. They were very rushed, being in Luxor for a few hours only, and I was so sorry not to see more of them.
Thursday. Januaarv 30. Doris and I had a lovely ride this afternoon. We went first over to the diggings to cheer Harry up a bit. He gets low in his mind if he doesn't see a white person to speak to occasionally. We went by a short cut which Doris loves and I hate because there's a fearsome plunge into a gully which I always descend shrieking "I want to get off -1 want to get off! O how I loathe this place!" While a sailor holds me on and Malimond says in that heavenly voice of his "Don1 be 'fraid Madame!" Yesterday the sailor and I took the plunge in a most lover-like manner, for I was clutching him around the neck and he had his arm around my waist. Harry clamored for us to stay, but we had a hankering to go somewhere we had not been before, so after a very big visit we continued on our way and finally - or should I say shortly - reached the hollow in the hills where nestles that gem of a temple (small enough for my limited comprehension) Der-el-Medineh. Such lovely carving, such delicious color left in scraps and patches, and peace and remoteness that I said "I would have liked to come here to church". And through a broad opening in the rocks a wide and beautiful view down to the distant Nile, with the stately ruin of the Ramesseum in the foreground. We had only fifteen minutes to spend there, but acquired that haunting desire to return there which is, for me, an Egyptian fever. The splendid looking Arab, guardian of the place, was so overcome by my largesse of seven and a half cents that he knocked Malimond out of the way in order to hold my donkey himself when I mounted. We rode home by our dear Colossi and Doris suddenly left me on a mad gallop to overtake a baby camel she saw in the distance. I finally caught it up without any undue exertion. I don't believe it could have been more than a month old. The maternal camel was not in the least gratified by our attentions and tried to take a bite out of Doris.
Friday. January 31. The only thing worthy of record today was tea, by invitation, with the Masperos on their Dahabya Miriam. It's a government boat and so ugly that I should think it would afflict them desperately to have to live on it. However, I come back from every other boat I see freshly impressed with the beauty and perfect order of this one. Sir Gaston was very twinkly this afternoon but did not have the opportunity to launch forth upon one of his marvelous monologues. We rowed home beneath a flight of crimson clouds with the upper reaches of the river rose and violet and the nearer ones fire opal.
Good-bye till another week and so much love to all, whether in Edwards Street, on the dear hilltop, or in Summerville.
Your devoted Mary
Sunday. February 2.
West Bank at Luxor
Dear Adeline:- There is such a wild wind from the desert tonight that the Beduin is rocking as she never did during the entire voyage up from Cairo. Always immediately after dinner I come into my room and hang out of my window for a few minutes to look at the stars and the lights of Luxor. Tonight they are veiled in sand. The wind rose in the afternoon. It was calm enough when Doris and I went to church this morning. Upon emerging from the sanctuary I had a little talk with Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Hutchins, Delia Porter'a relatives who are birds of passage through

Luxor. We brought Miss Buchanan home to luncheon. She it is who built up the Mission School (the American Mission) at Luxor, and who is head now of the larger one in Cairo, and whom Cousin Theodore admires so profoundly. Everyone does, I think. A little, very plain little woman, whose "outward semblance doth belie her soul's immensity". The beauty of that soul makes itself apparent to all kinds of people. A Sheik from the desert who came to one of the Commencements at the Mission School here said to one of the teachers, in speaking of Miss Buchanan, "Today for the first time in my life have I seen a Woman! How can I go back to those three - my wives!"
This afternoon the Fahnestocks came to tea and some English people named Rae puffed over in a steam Launch from Luxor, bringing Mohammed Mohassib. The old man enjoyed himself enormously, sat in various chairs, chuckling at everything, insisted on drinking tea, because it was the custom at this hour on this boat, though he disliked it greatly, and we were all telling him to wait a few minutes and he should have some coffee. We were disappointed because he wasn't clad in rich raiment - he being a millionaire - but he was bundled up in a brown and white checked shawl around his neck and an old brown overcoat with a hood to it, such as our sailors wear at night.
Monday. February 3. A heavenly day - like all the others that have gone before it. The wind ceased suddenly last night before it had tom us from our moorings, and this morning dawned as quietly as possible. Doris went over to Kamak for the forenoon with Margaret Fahnestock, and in the afternoon she rode out to the diggings with Cousin Theodore, while I spent the afternoon in the novel and thrilling occupation of falling in love with a Russian Princess. The Contessa had invited me to go to Karnak in a small party of which the Princess was one. We were to be shown about by M. Legrain himself (he has for years been conducting the excavations at Karnak). But that part fell through and it was Mme. Legrain who took us about, Legrain himself being absorbed with a dissipated looking Prince de Croix. But little I cared as long as I could gaze upon my Princess. Besides, I think we saw pretty much what we would have seen under Legrain's guidance.
We watched the workmen carefully unearthing a large and beautiful jar from a ruined and crumbling wall beyond the sacred lake. We held our breaths while it was being emptied, and let them out again when nothing but a brick was found inside. We went to the little temple of Ptah in one dusky room of which stands the uncanny black granite statue of Sekmet, the goddess with the lion's head. When you have looked at her for five minutes she becomes so vibrant with life that it is easy to understand why the Arabs believe that she sometimes prowls forth seeking whom she may devour. My chief pleasure this afternoon was watching the Princess - a fairy Princess, young, little, beautiful, quiet, with a delightful laugh and a perfect simplicity of manner. She looks like a high bred Englishwoman except that her eyes are somehow different. Her skin is healthily tanned with a lively color in it. She wore a most perfect pongee skirt, just off the white in tone, shoes to match, a short silk sweater coat of tawny orange, a hat like all our hats (bought in Cairo for $1.00) with a long veil, like all our veils only of a lighter shade than her sweater, a cane with a bloodstone sunk in the top of the handle, and a monocle on a black ribbon. She walked so well on her little feet and when she took off her gloves later at tea in the garden of the Luxor Hotel, her hands were covered with superb sapphires. Doris had seen her on the street in the morning, was insantly antagonized by the monocle, and came home saying she was "a sight" and that her donkey had shied at her. So much for the intolerance of youth. She is the Princess Gortschokoff and she has me bound to her chariot wheels.

Tuesday. February 4. Doris and I have had a perfect day. Harry elected to spend the holiday in the valley and invited Doris and me to come out to see the tomb of Horemheb, which neither of us had entered, and also that I might see the Siphtah sarcophagus, and then to lunch with him at the House. We got up early and had breakfast at eight (nine is the usual hour) and were off on our donkeys before the Cousins appeared. We rode via the landing place opposite Luxor and it was a sight worth seeing. Two steamers had come in last night and scores upon scores of people were bound for the valley and the hubbub and the color and the excitement! Scores and scores of donkeys with their gay trappings, scores and scores of donkey boys in blue and white and a dash of red on their chests, native policemen in khaki trying to keep order while their splendid camels lay waiting for them in the background - carriages, sand carts - and everybody shouting and talking at once. It was immensely amusing. I did enjoy my ride, and the light and the color on the Libyan Range were of surpassing beauty, but so blinding that we had to lower our chiffon veils.
We rode first to the House, to drop our donkeys and pick up Harry, and then we walked around to the Valley of the Tombs. We went first into Horemheb which is not a very easy tomb to enter, as the once kingly flights of steps leading down into it are not but crumbling masonry. But what beauty of painted walls when once you have made the descent, and what a superb sarcophagus! More interesting to me than the completed work were the walls where the designs were sketched in merely, looking as though the artist had just laid down his crayon and his brushes and gone home to luncheon. Horemheb is lighted by electricity - but Siphtah more appropriately by reflected sunlight from a large mirror at the mouth. The chief interest in Siphtah is the sarcophagus. They've not got the lid turned over yet, but the thing is very impressive from its size. The inscriptions on it seemed to me to be done in rather an archaic manrter, but Harry is of the opinion that that is because red granite is such a difficult medium.
It was horribly hot walking back to the House in the fierce light of noon, but it's the sort of heat one can stand if one's head and the back of one's neck are covered. We had a very gay luncheon with Harry and Mr. Launcelot Crane, and a lovely ride home. As we passed Howard Carter's diggings we were surprised to see that he was working his full force of 300 in spite of its being the holiday. He was probably doing it under orders from Lord Carnarvon. That rather damaged nobleman was standing under an awning arrangement, leaning on his cane, surveying the proceedings. When we reached the Beduin the Contessa was here and eight other people came soon after. Two of them were the Masperos to say good-bye, as they start down the river in the morning. Sir Gaston tells me that my Princess is the granddaughter of the old and famous Prince Gortschokoff; that she is married to a commoner by whose name she is never called! My mind is absorbed tonight between my passion for my Princess and my interest in the strange habits of camels. I passed one on the road this afternoon, which hated me instantly, and in order apparently to express its utter loathing it threw up one of its stomachs and swallowed it again with the most perfectly horrid noise I ever heard.
Wednesday. February 5. and Ash Wednesday too. I didn't go to church, but it was a self-denial not to, so I hope it's all right. The only exciting thing that has happened today was when a sailboat drew up at the side of the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet, friends of Doris's and mine, whom we had supposed were at home in Cleveland, Ohio. I followed them back in my boat to call on Mrs. Dodge. They are on their way up the River on one of Cook's steamers.
Thursday. February 8. and an entirely heavenly day as usual. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode out to the diggings, and Cousin Emma and I donned our war paint, crossed over to Luxor and took a carriage. We had some difficult in getting a nice looking one, because Mr. J. P. Morgan has arrived in his dahabya and he keeps she carriages and six donkeys waiting all day long on each
