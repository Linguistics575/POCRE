MARYB. NEWBERRY
Ellen Mary Buttles was bom on December 23, 1864 at Talmadge, Ohio. Her father, Levi Buttles was a professor at Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio. Her mother was Jennie Wright Buttles.
There were six children in the family, 4 boys and a two girls.
Her grandmother, Harriet Kilboume Buttles, was the sister of Byron Kilboume, one of the founders of Milwaukee.
When Mary was a child, a cousin of her mother's, Theodore Davis, a very wealthy lawyer, visited in Gambier and was enchanted with her. Seeing that the family was very large and their finances were limited, he asked if he could adopt Mary. His offer was refused, but my grandmother told me that she went to her room and cried her eyes out because she thought she would be stuck in Gambier forever and would never see the world!
Mary was married in Gambier in 1887 to Wolcott Ely Newberry of Cleveland. He was the son of a well-known geologist and paleontologist, John Strong Newberry who was a professor at Columbia. Wolcott was a graduate of the Columbia School of Mines and became manager of various mines in Colorado and later in Equador. They lived in Aspen for several years in the early 1890's and in Colorado Springs for a few years after that. Then he went to Equador to manage some mines there. Mary joined him there for six months. My grandfather became ill there and they returned to New Haven where he died in 1898 at the age of 35. She never remarried.
I don't know how she managed to bring up her two children, Doris and Roger (my father).	She
had very little money, but somehow she scrimped and saved and was able to send them to private schools and put my father most of the way through Yale by living in a boarding house in New Haven in one room with my Aunt Doris, and when my father came home on vacations, she would rent a room for him.
They used to go to Newport sometimes to visit Cousins Theodore and Emma Davis. One time Cousin Theodore suggested that Mary should buy herself some new clothes - he was tired of seeing the same dress on her. Whereupon she broke down and told him about her financial situation - and from then on he paid for my father's'education.
When my father came to Milwaukee to work for Bucyrus-Erie, his mother moved here also to keep house for him. And she lived here from then on. When Cousin Theodore died in 1922 or so, her inheritance made it possible to buy the first house she ever owned, "Windfall" on the River Road between the Schroeders and the Fullers, (which you may remember as the Squiers' house). She had many, many friends all over the world. She was noted for her little Sunday supper parties. She would prepare a chafing dish which she served herself. She trained the cateress, Elsie Possehl. Elsie's mother, Augusta Eisold, was her laundress and later became her cook, and Elsie's brother Elmer was her chauffeur/gardener/general factotum.
With gas rationing it became necessary for her to move to town, and she lived in an apartment at the Astor until she died in December 1945.
