Tuesday. February 4. Doris and I have had a perfect day. Harry elected to spend the holiday in the valley and invited Doris and me to come out to see the tomb of Horemheb, which neither of us had entered, and also that I might see the Siphtah sarcophagus, and then to lunch with him at the House. We got up early and had breakfast at eight (nine is the usual hour) and were off on our donkeys before the Cousins appeared. We rode via the landing place opposite Luxor and it was a sight worth seeing. Two steamers had come in last night and scores upon scores of people were bound for the valley and the hubbub and the color and the excitement! Scores and scores of donkeys with their gay trappings, scores and scores of donkey boys in blue and white and a dash of red on their chests, native policemen in khaki trying to keep order while their splendid camels lay waiting for them in the background - carriages, sand carts - and everybody shouting and talking at once. It was immensely amusing. I did enjoy my ride, and the light and the color on the Libyan Range were of surpassing beauty, but so blinding that we had to lower our chiffon veils.
We rode first to the House, to drop our donkeys and pick up Harry, and then we walked around to the Valley of the Tombs. We went first into Horemheb which is not a very easy tomb to enter, as the once kingly flights of steps leading down into it are not but crumbling masonry. But what beauty of painted walls when once you have made the descent, and what a superb sarcophagus! More interesting to me than the completed work were the walls where the designs were sketched in merely, looking as though the artist had just laid down his crayon and his brushes and gone home to luncheon. Horemheb is lighted by electricity - but Siphtah more appropriately by reflected sunlight from a large mirror at the mouth. The chief interest in Siphtah is the sarcophagus. They've not got the lid turned over yet, but the thing is very impressive from its size. The inscriptions on it seemed to me to be done in rather an archaic manrter, but Harry is of the opinion that that is because red granite is such a difficult medium.
It was horribly hot walking back to the House in the fierce light of noon, but it's the sort of heat one can stand if one's head and the back of one's neck are covered. We had a very gay luncheon with Harry and Mr. Launcelot Crane, and a lovely ride home. As we passed Howard Carter's diggings we were surprised to see that he was working his full force of 300 in spite of its being the holiday. He was probably doing it under orders from Lord Carnarvon. That rather damaged nobleman was standing under an awning arrangement, leaning on his cane, surveying the proceedings. When we reached the Beduin the Contessa was here and eight other people came soon after. Two of them were the Masperos to say good-bye, as they start down the river in the morning. Sir Gaston tells me that my Princess is the granddaughter of the old and famous Prince Gortschokoff; that she is married to a commoner by whose name she is never called! My mind is absorbed tonight between my passion for my Princess and my interest in the strange habits of camels. I passed one on the road this afternoon, which hated me instantly, and in order apparently to express its utter loathing it threw up one of its stomachs and swallowed it again with the most perfectly horrid noise I ever heard.
Wednesday. February 5. and Ash Wednesday too. I didn't go to church, but it was a self-denial not to, so I hope it's all right. The only exciting thing that has happened today was when a sailboat drew up at the side of the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet, friends of Doris's and mine, whom we had supposed were at home in Cleveland, Ohio. I followed them back in my boat to call on Mrs. Dodge. They are on their way up the River on one of Cook's steamers.
Thursday. February 8. and an entirely heavenly day as usual. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode out to the diggings, and Cousin Emma and I donned our war paint, crossed over to Luxor and took a carriage. We had some difficult in getting a nice looking one, because Mr. J. P. Morgan has arrived in his dahabya and he keeps she carriages and six donkeys waiting all day long on each
