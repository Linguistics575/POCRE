Shortly after luncheon Mr. Lancelot Crane appeared and stayed to tea. He and Harry and Doris and I always have a lot of amusement talking together. Two ladies, acquaintances of Cousin Emma’s, just down from Wadi Haifa on the Mayflower, also came to tea. At intervals during the day I watched the funny performances of the poultry, which amuse me so, and which form such a queer link between this strange and ancient land and the everyday, humble things at home. I really thought the devotion to Sir Francis Drake exhibited by his ladies was carried to excess when he pulled a feather out of himself and one of them instantly swallowed it. The yellow dog was lying contentedly on the sand while two turkeys walked round and round him relieving him of his fleas! And - to my great delight -1 saw a wild goose, flying with outstretched neck, between the river and the range.
Wednesday. March 12. Dendereh. It's hard to say which was the more beautiful - the dawn I saw this morning at Luxor or the sunset from the top of the temple here. It was a hectic leaving.
About eleven we got off, and for two hours before that the sands in our immediate vicinity were dotted with natives come to say good-bye in the hope of a final backshish. Mrs. Winlock and Dorothy Richardson rode over from the American House to bid us farewell. Mohammed Mohassib came in a steam launch and was both pathetic and impressive. He is a great personality. He is planning to take his grandson and go to Mecca later on - for when we and his other foreign friends are gone there will be "no nice people in Luxor, no nice people at all." He says that once when he went to Mecca he took "threeteen" people with him. As we passed the Luxor waterfront on our way down the river many handkerchiefs and scarfs (or is it scarves?) fluttered farewell -friends of the crew, tradesmen we had patronized, and an acquaintance or two. But most of the people we have known at Luxor this winter are already gone. It was so lovely coming down between poppy-covered banks. Have you ever heard of the poppies of Egypt? I never have. By the "Indian billow", yes - but never by the waters of the Nile.
"I strew these opiate flowers On thy restless pillow;
They were plucked in Orient bowers By the Indian billow.
May thy sleep be calm and deep
Like theirs who fell - not theirs who weep."
White and pink and violet and red they stretched in vast fields and were a joy to look upon.
We got here about five and Doris and I immediately started for the temple on foot. Jones said it was a "very short walk" and on this boat a very short walk means not more than ten minutes. But it's a number of years since Jones went to the temple and he had forgotten. It was a good two miles - a beautiflil walk - after we had traversed the native village - with the most heavenly evening light over miles and miles of emerald fields among which the road wound. But we got to the temple just in time to see the sunset from the roof. Then there was only time to hurry through the dim recesses of the temple itself, have a moment's glimpse of the most important crypt, the colored one, and then start back. When we left the Beduin we had an escort of two sailors - on our return journey we had a retinue of eight - two native men, two children and two goats having joined. One of the native men strode in front of us to shoo off dogs and donkeys and people, and all the rest followed in our wake. Doris and I chuckled consumedly at the idea of our tearing over Africa at nightfall with such a bodyguard. It was again augmented before we reached the boat by two more of the crew who had been sent out to see if anything had happened to us. Here let me say, apropos of the gentleman who preceded us and ruthlessly cleared our path -1 never can

thoroughly enjoy belonging to the conquering and superior races. I hate to have silent, poor, inoffensive people pushed off the public highway in order to give me three times more room than I need.
Thursday. March 13. Nag Hamadi. It has been a perfectly hateful day - with the wind blowing everything and everybody off the face of the earth. We tied up here in the middle of the day because it was too dangerous to go through the drawbridge in such a gale. It is a cold and glittering night. The Mayflower, presumably with Mr. Weston on board, is lying on the other side of the river, waiting for the opening of the bridge in the morning.
Friday. March 14. The Nile near Giegole. This has been a great day - one of the best we've had in Egypt. We reached Beliana about eleven I think, and as soon as we could after that we started for Abydos - Doris and Haneen on donkeys, and Amelie and I in a brougham (of all things in the world to drive about Egypt in) with a coronet on the door! Also there was a very gorgeous native policeman on a proud Arabian barb prancing beside us. They say Beliana is a very bad town - and somehow it looked it. The eight mile drive to Abydos is through such beautiful country. As you leave the town there seem to be great estates on either side with fine palm groves. Then come vast fields of grain, green and golden, and reaped and stacked and many flocks and herds, and the abodes of the tribes tending them are out in the broad flat topped stacks of grain! And there was so much joyous young life bounding and cavorting about the fields and on the highway, baby donkeys, baby camels, baby calves and kids and lambs. The temple of Teli I at Abydos is so surrounded by hills of rubbish that it has the effect of being a sunken one, and the facade is so very ruinous that the splendors of the interior are all the more striking, - the most beautiful carving, it seemed to us, that we've seen in Egypt. We found a Cook's party of about twenty-five having luncheon in the temple, and being starving we promptly had ours, beginning with a libation to the gods as Haneen dropped the water bottle just as we entered. It was delightful wandering about the temple. So much of the roof is gone that much of the place basks in sunlight. We did not go to the other temple - that of Rameses II - because it is a very inferior one, and we didn't want to take too much time. As we were leaving, the onslaught of natives with things to sell and natives who only wanted to beg and everybody yelling at once, and their vanquishing by Amelie, reminded me of a verse in the Psalms "They came about me like flies - and were extinct even as fire among thorns". Again we had the delights of the drive, marred only by a tearing wind. Once our horse shied violently at a Beduin riding by on a camel in the deep ditch by the high road. Our driver explained that the horse disliked the Beduin headdress. As we neared our Beduin on the road by the river we had to make our way through trains of camels laden with bags of onions which were being unloaded from ghiassas (I don't know how to spell them, but they are the native boats with the Viking prows and enormous sails). We got back in ample time to pull up stakes and make some headway before nightfall.
Saturday. March 15. Tied above Abutig. It's been another day spoiled by a tearing wind which destroys all the pleasure of being on deck. Early this morning before we were up we passed Cook's Steamer Amenartis on her way to Aswan, with Emily and Marian Whitney on board. I'm so sorry to have missed them at Luxor. We have passed Akhenim, a very large and flourishing native town, to which, according to tradition, a heathen princess once came riding to desecrate a temple, and the earth opened and swallowed her up. The most beautiful sight today was what looked like the preparing of a caravan to go somewhere into the interior - camels were being loaded with all kinds of strange things and the mingling of colors was quite ravishing. We are getting into the land of colored raiment again instead of the black and white of upper Egypt.
Good-bye, dears, much love from Your devoted Mary

Tuesday. March 18.
Going down the Nile.
Dearest Adeline:- This trip down the Nile, to which we looked forward with such keen pleasure, remembering the rapture of the one up, has been a great disappointment because of the incessant and violent winds. Cousin Emma has scarcely been on deck at all. The rest of us have spent much time there, but usually with a growing irritation at being blown off the map, until the point would be reached when one or all of us would leap out of our chairs with an exasperated "I'm going down - this is too much for me." I can't remember whether I finished my last letter Saturday or Sunday. But anyway I did not tell you, did I, about the lovely walk I had just before sunset and just after on Sunday evening? We tied up a little earlier than usual by a lovely bank, and I started out immediately with Amelie and the usual sailors. We took to what Amelie (who knows this country well) called the highroad. It was literally that, being on sort of an embankment with deep ditches on either side. But it was little more than a footpath winding indefinitely through desert stretches, fascinating villages and cultivated fields, and palm trees scattered almost everywhere. It was such a lovely thing to be doing Palm Sunday, and the whole thing looked as I imagine Palestine.
Yesterday nothing particular occurred except our stopping at Minya for mail. Doris and I walked to the post office with Jones and sailors and then to the railroad station, thereby seeing the main part of the town, which is a flourishing one but not interesting. Today we spent four or five hours a little below Shekh Fadl while the tug coaled. We were tied to a high and very dull bank, and in four or five hours even the ducks can cease to amuse.
Wednesday. March 19. This has been a day. A hideous wind, as usual. Then early this morning we sat on a sandbank for an hour in company with Cook's large steamers, a small steamer and twenty-seven native boats. We were the first to get off and sail away and I suppose they all hated us. For the rest of the day we've played tag with the Arabia and the Rameses III (the two big Cook steamers). They would pass us haughtily, then around a bend in the river we'd find them stuck again and we'd sail by. I don't know how many times that happened. And once when we came upon them stranded and our tug went aground on the same bar for a few minutes, in its frantic struggles to get free it rammed the Rameses, which must have annoyed that monarch greatly. We are tied up tonight about thirty miles from Cairo and a new hat. I hunger and thirst for a new hat. There are no words to express the fatigue that takes possession of me when I don one of my two sun-burned, faded, pinned out, dilapidated head coverings. We are to continue living on the boat for about a week before moving to the Gazireh Palace. It is with a pang that we have today lost sight of the desert, on the edge of which for three months we have lived in a highly civilized and luxurious way - minus, of course, two things that are supposed to go with civilization now. We've not seen a motorcar since leaving Cairo and we couldn't have telephoned anywhere to save our lives!
Thursday. March 20. - Cairo. We started a little before six this morning and were lucky enough to make the bridge just before it closed after the morning opening. If we'd been ten minutes later we would not have got through until afternoon. The wind kept on with unabated zeal but we found the entrance into the city's environs very interesting. I wonder if custom could stale for me the interest, ever. Our tying up place looks perfectly charming - it's the beauty spot of the bank. Not being here to superintend the planting ourselves, our gardener has got that mixture of everything - purple and red and pink - that the Oriental loves, but the effect is gay and springlike,
