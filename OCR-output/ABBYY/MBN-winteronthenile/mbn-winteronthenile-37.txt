we again passed the patriotic display of bunting that adorable Eleanor Pier, aged seven, said "Whose birthday is this? Did you say it was President Taft's?"
The Dodges joined me at the Winter Palace and we had tea on the rear terrace, and it was awfully nice to be with friends from my native state. Doris and Janet Dodge had spent the whole morning together at Kamak, so Doris thought she would better ride to the diggings with Cousin T. instead of coming to tea.
Now I'm going to wind up with two nice, appropriate little tales. Two or three years ago when on the 22nd of February the Beduin was in her gala dress to do honor to the day, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, coming down the river from Aswan, thought it was in their honor, and did everything except fire a salute to express their appreciation of the attention! And once in the days when my relatives had that superb dragoman Mohammed Sala (that was before Jones had qualified as a dragoman) he was much offended that he had not been informed the day beforehand that this important anniversary was pending. Hearing someone say at the breakfast table "This is Washington's Birthday - the boat must be dressed", he hurried out. Returning he said to Cousin Emma "Madam, the cook say it is not possible to prepare a fitting luncheon for the day without some notice." "I didn't want a special luncheon - the cook gives us too much to eat always, as it is", said Madam. At the close of luncheon, entered Mohammed Sala, bearing a colossal cake with the American flag in colored frosting on it. He placed it on the table and with a look of deep reproach at Cousin Emma, he announced "Le gateau pour Mr. Washington!" I had the pleasure of seeing Mohammed Sala today. On getting into the felucca after leaving the Winter Palace, the men held it while beckoning and calling to someone on the neighboring boat. Then Sala came hurrying along the bank, stepped into the felucca and bowed low over my hand. He said he was here "with one prince". After an exchange of compliments he departed. He is usually with important people. He was twice with the Empress of Austria, and she nearly killed him walking out to the Pyramids from Cairo and back every morning before breakfast.
Goodnight, dears all.

Dearest Adeline:- The Contessa and I had planned to go on a picnic a deux to the tombs of the Nofiles today, but at breakfast time a boat brought a note saying a heavy cold on her chest prevented her going. As I had on my hateful riding things (never donned except for my donkey) I decided to take a ride anyway. Neither Doris nor Cousin Theodore would go with me, so I went alone, quite thrilled because it was the first time in fifteen days that I had ridden. It was the dullest ride I ever had. Wadi Haifa needed the inspiration of others of his kind. We started off with Malimond tugging at his head and a sailor pushing from behind. Shouts, duckings, gurglings had no effect whatever on him. Whacks simply made his hindquarters go suddenly sideways in the disconcerting movement that almost unseats me. It took me an hour to get out to the Colossi, so there I turned about, relinquishing the Valley of the Queens for which I was headed and which I've not yet seen. If Malimond and the sailor had even talked to each other it would have been less depressing. I kept getting sadder and sadder and Egypt began to seem to me a lonely land of Doom, when I was suddenly cheered by the sight of a camel loaded with trunks and making for the American House. A camel can always pluck me out of melancholy. It was very hot coming home and I had to keep my veil down to prevent breathing tiny black flies.
