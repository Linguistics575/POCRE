We passed Kasr-es-Saiyad ("the Hunter's Castle") today and saw an amazing sight. What well might have been a castle was a pigeon house and nothing else. Hundreds of thousands of pigeons were perched upon its battlements, wheeling over it, swooping about it, while fresh flocks were hurrying towards it from all directions. Opposite Kasr-es-Saiyad lies Hon, the home of Shjekh Seline who died a few years ago after sitting stark naked on the banks of the Nile for 53 years. They have built his tomb on the sacred spot and the natives make pilgrimages to it.
We expect to reach Luxor tomorrow and I shall begin a fresh letter there. It will be good to get letters. Ten days without mail is a long while.
Adios, my dears all, and Heaven bless you.
Devotedly,
Mary
Christmas Eve. 1912.
Dahabya Beduin Luxor, Egypt
"By the fertile stream Where, in Egyptian Thebes, the heaps of precious ingots gleam,
The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state Of valiant men with steeds and cars March through each massy gate."
Don't you love that, Adeline? And to think that I am here! I cannot get used to the wonder of that. We reached here at noon on Saturday, a day like all our days - soaked in sunshine. We slipped "past garden wall and gallery" with glimpses of those lovely columns of the Temple of Luxor in between; past the Winter Palace, and then diagonally across the river to our mooring place on the west bank. We have it all to ourselves because most people prefer to herd in the thick of things on the east bank with their noses bumping each other's tails, until there isn't an inch left in which to tie a boat. So we are sole owners at present of a wide and lovely beach, back of which stretches a wondrous plain of strips of burning sand and strips of brilliant green and lines of trees, and back of all the glaring fiercely beautiful Libyan mountains where our valley lies. We made an encampment with the dahabya, a tent for the sailors, a lot of stylish yellow poles to which the clothes lines are attached, and two luxurious yellow coops into which the poultry farm is shoved at sunset. It was too amusing when the small coops were first lifted off the Beduin onto the sand and opened. Sir Francis Drake and his three ladies waddled madly for the edge of the bank, slid down it on their tails and hurled themselves into the water. The turkeys were so stiff they could hardly stand at first, but in less than five minutes the gobbler was strutting and rustling and gobbling as though he owned upper Egypt, including the Sudan, while the hen turkey was busily superintending one of the crew polishing copper pots with sand. To see the white cock stepping jauntily about no one would have imagined him to be a heart-broken widower, all his wives having been eaten on the way up. Perhaps he foresaw that he would have three more in about an hour and a half. At luncheon the mail was brought from across the river, our first in 10 days, and we buried ourselves in letters. There was a dear one from you, Adeline. The afternoon waned in perfect beauty, of which I recked nothing, having suddenly gone to bed with a fiendish attack of neuralgia in my face. It passed after four or five hours and I slept like an infant and woke up Sunday morning very fit indeed and wishing greatly to go to the English Church at

Luxor and thank God for all His goodness. But my face was swollen still and Cousin Emma protested against my going, as the church, she said, was apt to be cold. So we all spent the morning on the boat.
In the afternoon Cousin Theodore, Doris and I and Jones, all in our riding clothes, were rowed over to Luxor in the felucca, and there our own donkeys and our own saddles and our own donkey boys were awaiting us, and off we rode to Karnak with our boys running beside us. And along the waterfront of Luxor Cousin Theodore had an ovation. Lines of dragomans and humble folk rose to their feet and beamingly shouted a welcome to him. As his own donkey boy said, kissing his hand, "All the world is thankables that Mr. Davis are come back!" They say he is known up and down the Nile as "The Friend of the Poor".
It is impossible, I think, for anyone to describe those stupendous ruins with their deathless beauty and immortal splendor. It seized upon me almost like a sudden grief that stayed till the late afternoon chill began to tinge the air, and then ambled back on our donkeys. I adore riding a donkey. Mine is named Sugar, and my delightful little donkey boy, with the most engaging smile, is Malimond. Yesterday morning Doris and I attended by Malimond and Nobi (Doris's boy) rode again to Karnak and poked about alone with a map, and felt sorry for people being conducted by vociferating guides. On getting back to Luxor we joined the Cousins who were walking in the Winter Palace Gardens with Mr. Charles Whymper, that delightful Englishman with a much too loud voice, who writes pleasant books about birds and illustrates them with his own lovely pictures. Whymper, the mountain climber, was his brother. In the afternoon Cousin Theodore and Doris went off on their donkeys across the sands toward the Lybian hills and I, with six of the crew to row me and the ferocious second captain perched like a gigantic black bird at the stern, and Jones as escort, went over to Luxor to visit some of the native shops. We paid a visit to Mohammed Muhassib - the great and reliable dealer in antiquities, and because of his regard for Cousin Theodore, I was received with pomp and graciousness by the hoary, turbaned old Arab, and conducted into an inner treasure room where the casual purchaser never penetrates. We had his youngest grandson, a beguiling baby in yellow satin and fez-shaped cap of white, brought in and introduced to me. And then he gave me coffee fit for the gods, and I bought a small alabaster vase, and with many salutations I departed. I heard him telling Jones that one of his wives - "the old one" had died. They opened the dam at Assonan yesterday - a real attention to me on my birthday - and the Khedive and Lord Kitchener were there. I'd rather see Lord Kitchener than any man in the world.
This morning Doris and I were rowed across and spent the best of the morning being shampooed and manicured. The young German who shampooed me kept ejaculating "Shocking - shocking" at the way my hair fell out. Just after we got back in the Beduin, a steam dahabya flying many flags, the Stars and Stripes among them, came steaming down the river and people waved to us from the deck, and we knew it was the Serapis with Emily Morgan and Miss Nelson and the rest of the Tuck party. And as soon as we could after luncheon we rowed over and called. And it was a joy indeed to see those two dear things. They are coming to tea tomorrow afternoon, which will make Christmas seem a little more like Christmas.
Artin Pasha has got our party somewhat confused. I've had a note from him addressed to "Mrs. Burton" and beginning "My dear Mrs. Burton". Harry came over from the valley this afternoon to spend Christmas, and I asked him if I were his mother or if he had married me for my money. He was terribly teased.

The sailors - our sailors - have been rejoicing this evening, sitting in a circle on the lower deck singing songs that sounded like heathen incantations - all this because Cousin Theodore has given them a sheep for a feast tomorrow. I would like to hear someone sing Heilige Nacht. The glory of the Lord is filling the heavens. There is such moonlight as New England never has known.
Christmas Night, 1912 - It's rather queer that snow and Yule logs and holly should be so essentially a part of the ideal Christmas to the Anglo-Saxon mind, when of course the real Christmas surroundings are like Doris's and Emily's and mine today - delicious sunshine and warmth, tropical vegetation, arid desert stretches. Just for today I would gladly have exchanged all this for the snow and the Yule log and Home. We had our presents before and at breakfast, and when the dining room table was cleared the ceremony of giving the crew and inside servants (there are 23 of these, mostly Nubians) their Christmas, took place. Cousin Theodore and Cousin Emma sat at the table, Doris and I on the divan, and Jones was master of ceremonies. They came in one by one, kissed our hands, said "Kulle sana w'uita taiyib" (a Happy New Year to you), each received a white shawl, a box of cigarettes, a bag of nuts and candy and some money. When it was over with they gathered on the deck and shouted "Hip, hip, hip, Hooray! Tank you, tank you, tank you!" And the rest of us washed our hands in dioxygen.
Doris and Emily and I went to the little white stucco English church, which stands at the back of the Luxor Hotel gardens, walking among palms and acacias and other lovely things to get to it, and arriving in time to see an Arab give the final vigorous rings to the outside bell. The church was trimmed with palms and poinsettias, and of course there was the dear old service and the joyful Christmas hymns, and a quite unusual thrill at the prayer for "The President of the United States" even though he was tacked on at the tail end of the Royal Family.
Doris and I brought Harry Burton and Mr. Crane back in the felucca to have luncheon with us, and the Beduin looked more that ordinarily beautiful in her gala dress of many flags. Mr. Crane is an artist and son of the better known Walter Crane, a very nice fellow and with a decided sense of humor, though not as constantly amusing as Harry Burton. We had a gay luncheon, and when the young men had departed for the other side of the river, Doris and I were free to read our fine crop of letters, and we did it with a ravenous appetite. At four the Serapis with all her flags flying steamed up near us and her felucca brought over Mr. and Mrs. Tuck, Major Curley, Miss Nelson and Emily - and you can all of you easily imagine what it meant to Doris and me to have even an hour of Miss Nelson and Emily. We took the whole party all over the Beduin and they were crazy about it. Then we had tea on deck with the Nile flowing by us on one side and our splendid plain and mountains on the other and sunshine and beauty eveiywhere. We could not bear to have our guests leave, but they left, and then Cousin Theodore and I took a walk on the sands with the sunset in our faces, and had to hurry back to escape the sudden mists that always arrive at sundown. We found Nicoll, the English artist who paints such exquisite pictures of Egypt, calling on us. I liked him immensely. He was asked to stay to dine, but had a previous engagement. So we four dined alone and had so much to eat before the turkey arrived that he was sent off untouched. But we had to nibble at the plum pudding. I pledged you all in champagne, and later on saw one of the crew dancing a sort of double shuffle with the bottle balanced on his head. It has been a lovely Christmas in its queer way, but Emily and the letters and remembrances from home were far and away the best part of it.
Thursday. December 26. The Serapis went on her way to Cairo this morning. It is a very great disappointment to Doris and me that they did not stay long enough for us to do things together -and to Emily and Miss Nelson too. But they are, at present, no more the arbiters of their destinies
