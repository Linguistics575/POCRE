heartiest welcome, my fondest thoughts to you both, wishing had been able to come down with Jim. Am with you in my heart. Sending love to all." He told Jim Whittaker that he "would have given his soul" to come to Naples to meet us, but his mother was ill and he couldn't.
Now I must send this and write to someone else.
Faithful love,

Shepheard's Hotel Cairo
Dearest Adeline - I've seen the Sphinx. In hot sunlight, with a sky of a blue to make one gasp, with the desert wind in our faces and desert sand sifting into our shoes, with an atmosphere of molten pearls in the distance, with here and there a white-robed Arab, a stately camel, a white donkey with gay trappings, with the pyramids towering in the background - we saw her. No description I have ever read, no picture I have ever seen had prepared me. I'd like to sit and look at her for days. The pyramids are tremendously impressive to think about, but it did not thrill me to see them; and I cannot describe the feeling that surged through me when I faced the Sphinx. Doris and I wanted to climb the Great Pyramid but Cousin Theodore absolutely refused to have us boosted by Arabs so we had to give it up. The Sphinx has been our great experience since my last letter.
For the rest, the Arabian nights continues. We are wakened in the morning by the cry of the kites wheeling above the garden. When I fling open my blinds and look into said garden with its towering palms, its wonderful plants, its vivid lawns, I see a crane stepping "high, wide and handsome" along the bright red paths. This morning as I was standing on the terrace in front of the hotel a man went by on the sidewalk with a goat trotting along on one side of him and a monkey on the other. The white-robed, red-sashed, befezzed individual who salaams as he opens the dining room door for us, wears a silver ring inserted coyly in the top of his right ear.
Gorgeous creatures, glittering with gold embroidery, seated at intervals in the halls, rise and salaam as we pass. But the thing that, even after a week here, strikes me as being a masquerade and not real life is the women on the sidewalks or in beautifully appointed carriages who look mysteriously at you with dark eyes gleaming above the white veil that hides the rest of their faces.
The woman on the sidewalk for the most part wears the black veil, but she in the victoria or brougham wears the white.
Yesterday after church at All Saints where Mr. Sayce preached an excellent sermon on "Thy Kingdom Come", Harry Burton and I drove to the Blue Mosque, crumbling but very beautiful and with several interior walls covered with superb Persian tiles, any one of which I should consider a treasure. Hundreds of youths and boys were seated in groups on the ground reciting the Koran at the top of their lungs. In the afternoon we had a little tea on the dahabeah (its name is the Beduin) and, while awaiting our guests, were infinitely amused watching the antics of our white cock and gorgeous drake each trying to assert supremacy over a certain spot on the bank. The drake was victorious and then proceeded to make himself look exactly like Napoleon.
Our guests were Mr. Sayce, Artin Pasha, and an Egyptian gentleman Claudius Bey, whose hair turned snow white a few years ago when he went to meet his wife on an incoming steamer at Alexandria and found her murdered in her cabin. His two little girls, aged seven and five, are living in England with their Grandmother, and he said he fancied he would have to go live in England too, as they absolutely refused to come back to Egypt - seven and five! I had an
7
absorbingly interesting talk with Mr. Sayce, who told me some inside history about Gordon, who has always been one of my heroes.
This afternoon Harry Burton and I dashed out in the motorcar to see the obelisk. He couldn't tell me what obelisk and the guidebook had been sent to the Beduin. But it was worth going to see, and in the neighborhood was an estate enclosed in one of those high mud walls that fascinate me so, and between the obelisk and the wall a flock of goats were feeding, shepherded by three shrouded figures - quite perfect as a picture.
Harry starts for Luxor tonight by train. There isn't a room for him on the dahabeah, worse luck -he's one of the most amusing persons I've ever known.
We board the Beduin tomorrow some time. It's all enchanting whether we go or stay.
Goodbye, dears all, for this time.
Devotedly,
Mary

Dahabya Beduin Egypt
Dearest Adeline
Our first night on the dahabeah (it really doesn't matter much how you spell it - though I doubt not that the way at the top of this is really the most knowing). We spent the morning in preparations to move from the hotel, paying bills, etc., and dashing across the street for final purchases at little shops. Also Cousin Theodore elected to make it Christmas for Doris and me, bestowing upon Doris a pearl and diamond ring and upon me a gold mesh bag - much too elegant for 615 Orange Street, but which really suits me to a T! At about 2:30, after tipping whole tribes of Arabs and other more commonplace nations of the earth, we four entered the bright red motor car and scooted Nile-wards, followed by Jones and Amelie in another vehicle, the tops of their heads just visible above the masses of hand luggage packed around them. Although we had visited the Beduin daily it was with quite a different sensation that we stepped down our flowery bank (we have quite a garden) and really took possession. Then we all set to work putting innumerable belongings into what seemed absolutely inadequate spaces for them. But we finally evolved perfect order, the unpacked trunks were sent back to Cook's and the whole place looks like the Abode of Peace - a very luxurious Peace, I grant you! On answering a twice repeated summons to tea on the upper deck, I found a foreign gentleman of - to me - most unpleasant personality, who on being introduced to me, rose, brought his heels together, swept off is hat and bowed from the waist. Having had my tea and not being fascinated with the Russian, I sauntered off. I was told afterwards that he is a first cousin to the Czar, is fabulously rich, has an Egyptian museum of his own in Moscow, and for a long time was in the habit of bringing with him to the Nile a new wife each year. Whether at the end of each winter he fed the lady to the crocodiles, or reserved her for Siberia, history does not record.
There is about a ton of brown bread cut in slices spread out to dry on the deck at the stern. It's for the crew. They like it that way. The birds hop joyously all over it, and a cat or two pay thieving visits to it. The crew and inside servants are twenty in number and are so silent it is hard to believe there is one on board. They wear blue sweaters with BEDUIN in red letters across the
8
heart, blue robes with gay bandanas tied about the waist and white turbans. All except the two captains, who wear black robes and no sashes. And also except Haneen the butler, whose raiment is much more important. He, I believe, is a Capt. and wears a fez instead of a turban. The second captain is a wholly ferocious looking individual. He looks as though he'd like to cut all our throats for the simple pleasure of doing it. But he's been on the Beduin for years and is a great friend of Jones, so I suppose he won't. There was a rose and orange and gold and turquoise and violet and dove grey and sea green sunset tonight and the slenderest thread of a new moon anyone ever saw. We hope to get off tomorrow. We are merely waiting for the tug which is to tow us.
Wednesday. December 11.
No tug appeared today; instead there came a young man from the firm of whom the tug is engaged, a gay and smiling youth named Schwartz, who announced that a telegram had come saying the tug was coaling at some place up the river and would arrive early in the morning. "A day late," I said. The Elders were napping so Doris and I were conducting the interview. "A day late", he said with a gay shrug, "but what is a day?". " Nothing in Egypt" I had to admit, and truly it has been so interesting watching the lazy life of the river that I don't care at all whether we go or stay. Mr. Schwartz plied us with questions, winding up with "This is a government boat?"
"No, it is Mr. Davis'own. He had it built." "And you are going up the river alone?" "There are four of us." "But how dull! Me, I should want sixteen in the party!" Think of having to be polite for ten or eleven days in the narrow confines of a dahabya, to sixteen people! Doris and I would not in the least object to one man - the vastly amusing Harry Burton - but he went to Luxor by train last night, there being no room for him on the Beduin.
Thursday. December 12. The tug came before we were up this morning, but we had to wait till the bridge opened at ten. It was very entertaining to see people trying to get across before the bridge should become useless, as such, for an hour and a half. Doris and I fell into an unseemly fit of giggling over a funeral, all on foot, "beating" it over the bridge as though they were going to a fire. When the draw swung we slipped through, followed by another dahabya flying the Stars and Stripes. We have no idea whose she is - we only know we sailed away from her early in the day and have had no glimpse of her since.
It has been a vivid Egyptian day with all that that means of light and color. And what scenes!
How can I even try to give the faintest idea of their strangeness, their charm, their savage or seductive beauty? And the River itself - small wonder that people have worshipped it for centuries. It has a human personality which I feel. For long after leaving Cairo we passed towns or scattered habitations more or less Cairo-like in their look and construction - cream colored walls and an air of civilization. Those came to an end and then there were long stretches of country, scattered native villages made of mud, with a beauty all their own, towering palms here and there - large groves of them sometimes - then the grain fields with a hum of industry about them and great barges being loaded or unloaded - and always behind them on the East Shore the Arabian desert with its line of hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, fierce, desolate, burning, superbly beautiful beneath the magic of the Egyptian sun, but intolerable to even imagine under a gloomy sky. At sunset we tied up to the bank between two tiny native hamlets. To effect the tying up process one of the crew goes ashore with the anchor on his shoulder (this is a true statement) and worries it into the sand; two of the crew go ashore each with an enormous wooden pin the size of a country hitching post; two more of the crew, armed with gigantic wooden mallets, hammer these pins into the sand and to these we are tied. Then a desert stillness settles down upon us, while the stars blaze out overhead.
