thorn bushes of the desert he drew the snakes and never once when he would pounce on a rock and turn it over did he fail to find a scorpion. And the scorpions stung him and the snakes bit him, and then he would drop them into a strong basket with a weighted plug-like stopper to it, and a cord handle to carry it by. We lunched in one of the side rooms of the temple and when rested and comfortably full of bread and butter and sardines and pate de foie gras and cake and ginger ale and Turkish coffee, we rose up and demanded a cobra. It was against the rules to hunt for it in the temple, Maspero having forbidden it, but we did it. Through one great court we followed the Arab and his incantation, then into another, and when he began pushing his sleeves up to his shoulders we knew he smelled his quarry (that's what he does - he smells them). He stepped from ruined wall to ruined wall and suddenly bent forward with what sounded like a shout of command, and out from a crack between two great blocks of stone slid the wicked head of a cobra. With a jerk of his stick the Arab brought the four feet of reptile out and it slipped and curved over the pavement, then raised its head, spread its hood and struck. It didn't hit anything but I heard its jaws come together. Then the Arab picked it up and showed us its fangs and it struck again, leaving drops of poison on his sleeve. Then the Contessa took it and holding it tightly just back of the venomous head she put it around her neck. It was, to me, an absolutely revolting spectacle.
She and Mr. Tremaine both wear charms that the Arab has given them. I asked Mr. Tremaine to tell me as man to man whether or not he believed in his charm. To which he replied that this much he knew - that not for anything would the Arab let any of the rest of us, who had no charm, handle the snakes which he permitted him and the Contessa to take hold of freely. His theory is that the charms are saturated with some kind of essence of snake which the snakes smell and which renders the wearers more or less immune. The show over we all ambled home in a rather spectacular train in the lovely sunlight across the Memnonian plain. And Cousin Theodore didn't believe a word of it.
Wednesday. January 22. This afternoon I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace -mixed doubles. My partner was a very, nice Scotsman named MacNaughton, and we defeated English lords and German baronesses and commoners like ourselves, and won the first prize. And not a Yale athlete of them all can boast a cup like mine. It pursued me in a boat from the Winter Palace, for I had beaten a modest retreat, not knowing that I had won anything.
Friday. June 24. Yesterday Doris and I had a lovely afternoon. Mrs. Pier had invited us over to the Winter Palace for the Gym Khana, and we sat and baked in the sunshine and were much amused watching the sports and the crowds of people. Luxor seems very full just now and there are two or three American dahabyas tied up on that side, though I don't know who is on them.
Today, in the afternoon. Cousin T., Doris and I rode over to our new diggings at Medinet Habu. Harry began there yesterday and says he is glad to be working above ground. The children who were carrying off the dirt were all singing some sort of chant. "Have they been singing like that all day?" I asked. "Oh, no!" said Harry,"they are simply singing 'The Boss has come, the Boss has come.'" The light was perfectly exquisite as it fell on Lybian Cliffs, on stately temple walls, on heaps of rubbish, on spots of truly emerald verdure, on a lonely Coptic Monastery far off in the desert, and on one splendid Beduin swinging on his camel over the sands toward the western sun, twirling his camel stick in the air.
Good-bye, dears all, till another week.
Your devoted Mary

Sunday. January 26.
West Bank at Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- How does that Watts hymn go? "Oh day so calm, so still, so bright" -1 don't believe I've got it right and very likely it wasn't Watts who perpetrated it, but anyway "so calm, so still, so bright" describes all our Sundays here (and all other days except when the wind blows).
"So still" did not exactly depict the part of the morning when Mr. Whymper was breakfasting with us. He is awfully nice and very amusing - but Dio Mio! what a voice! The whole boat was filled with the sound thereof and I could see Cousin Theodore wilt beneath it. Rarely have I met anyone who dislikes as much as does Charles W. to have anyone else talk, so when he is present there is little respite from that battering sound. I'm beginning to understand why his lawful and wedded doesn't live with him, but resides somewhere in the country in England with the daughter, and occasionally allows Charles to pay them a visit. He and Doris and I rowed over to church together. Our regular incumbent was absent, preaching in the Cathedral at Khartoum, and we had two clerical birds of passage in his place. The sermon, an excellent one, was preached by the Rev. Urquhart Bing Urquhart (isn't that a delicious name?) And the service was read by a little man who looked like an owl but who had a charming voice and read beautifully. In connection with him Mr.Whymper told us such a nice little tale. He - the Rev. Owl (I forget his name) is rector in a little town in England called Dunmow (where General Bing, now commanding all the forces in Egypt, lives when he's at home). And there it has been a custom from time immemorial, to give once a year a whole flitch of bacon to the married couple who on that day can, with their hands upon the altar, swear solemnmly that for the preceding year not a single cross word has passed between them! If more than one couple present themselves and take this solemn oath, whichever one can best substantiate the assertion receives the flitch of bacon.
Mr. Tremaine came home to luncheon with us and I'm sure had a very dull time. No - he didn't come with us, he followed later, and the Contessa was to have come with him but had a bad headache and couldn't, and he looked almost dismembered without her. Doris rode over to the diggings at Medinet Habu this afternoon with her donkey boy and a sailor. She and I had a lovely ride yesterday afternoon around by the Ramesseum and home by the Colossi, where we paused and got off to examine the creatures, which we have not done before. When we reached the Beduin we found Mrs. Pier and her two little girls. Those little girls are the very sweetest things I've seen in ages. They were having a heavenly time in our poultry yard as we rode up.
Monday. January 27. I foresee that this letter is going to be dull for anyone to read, for I don't seem to be doing anything off the boat just now except society things. (I'm lunching out tomorrow and the next day). I literally did not step off the boat till late this afternoon when Cousin Theodore and I went on the sands for a walk which he thought long and I thought short. We were all to have gone over to the diggings this afternoon. Cousin Emma in her donkey chair and we on our mounts, but just as we were all ready to start Cousin T. said he had a headache and wouldn't go, so I stayed at home with him, and the others went. At teatime they returned in a sort of whirlwind of donkeys and people, having picked up the Contessa and Mr. Tremaine and their outrunners. And at the same time a boat drew up on the other side of the Beduin and deposited a very charming Englishwoman - a Mrs.Graham, whose husband belongs to the Civil Service in Egypt, and who is an old acquaintance of the cousins. Poor Cousin Theodore was reduced almost to a panic, as he always is nowadays by the arrival of people. I admired Mrs. Graham vastly, in spite of an absolutely expressionless way of speaking which I generally find irritating when I meet it. Something quite thrilling was told her by Mr. Tremaine, and she murmured in a perfectly colorless voice "How exciting" as she buried her nose in her teacup.

Tuesday. January 28. Harry came over early this morning (have I said that Tuesday is the weekly holiday here?) and took Doris on an expedition to Kamak. Mr. Howard Carter came from his diggings about eleven and stayed, politely quarreling with all of us, until time to escort Cousin Emma and me to the Dahabya Cheops, just below us, where he and we were lunching with the Fahnstocks.
Mr. Howard Carter merits a paragraph to himself. He is a young Englishman and one of the very best diggers in Egypt. He used to dig for Cousin Theodore until they quarreled (not politely, I fear). Now he digs for lord Carnarvon. He can be perfectly charming, I'm told. This morning he was probably liverish for he disagreed with everything that was said. Fleas were mentioned. He said there were no fleas in this part of Egypt! Cousin Emma then asserted that there were even worse things than fleas in this part of Egypt. He insisted on knowing what she meant. Goaded to desperation she finally replied succinctly "Flesh-lice". "You can't acquire those", said he, "they are parasites. The develop on the bodies of the persons who have them." "I've had them!" said the dainty little lady. "You can't have had them", asserted Mr. Carter. "Play that piece!" he said, pouncing on me as I was playing dominoes with Cousin T; it annoys me excessively to be watched when I'm playing dominoes, and more so to be ordered about during the process. So I played another piece and lost the game. "Why didn't you play the piece I told you to?" he demanded. (It was the first time I had ever talked to the man in my life.) "Because you told me to", I replied. Whereupon he laughed and began to be pleasant. The luncheon with the Fahnstocks was very agreeable, but with oceans too much to eat. I sat between an Italian Count-who is here buying up lands to start a Franciscan or Dominican (I don't know which) monastery, and Mr. Tremaine (the Contessa was at the other end of the table.) Mr. Tremaine is beginning to assume godlike proportions in my mind since he told me that "one of his homes" is in Cornwall and that he owns a magnificent cliff near Tintagel. Think of. owning a piece of that rapturous coast!
This evening Doris has, I'm happy to say, gone to dine with those lovely Piers at the Winter Palace and to stay for the dance afterwards.
Wednesday. January 29. Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings this morning and I mended frantically until time to put on my very swagger serge (made by Hamilton & Co. of Chapel St., and a credit to them) and go over to the Winter Palace to lunch with the Piers. The little girls lunched with us - as I hoped they would - and each one of them gave me a lovely pink rose. They looked like lovely pink roses themselves. Nothing on earth could be sweeter than they are. We had a charming time, and then I got a carriage and drove Mrs. Pier out to the American Mission School in which the Cousins have been so interested for years. Cousin T. always keeps seven orphan girls there. As soon as any are graduated others take their place. There are three American women teachers, a Scotch housekeeper and a number of native women teachers. The chief difficulty in the mechanism of the school is the feeding of the pupils - each meal has to be served in three sections, according to caste, and with different food for each caste. It's a fine new building extending around a square court, and most of the rooms are light and airy. They, the teachers, insisted upon our having tea with them and gave us some delicious Scotch shortcake and another kind of cake - quite the best I've had in Egypt. Then I came home and had another tea,
Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero being here for that function. He is surely one of the most delightful men in all the wide world. I fancy Lady M. is very agreeable when with people who can jabber French but she will not exert herself in the least for those who move haltingly through the mazes of the Gallic tongue. She allowed herself a moment of enthusiasm when we were hanging over the rail watching the ducks, who know as well as anyone when it's teatime. "Comme il est enorme, le gros!" was almost the only spontaneous remark I heard her make. In the middle of the Masperos' visit a steam launch came puffing and clattering up and a beautiful woman and her
