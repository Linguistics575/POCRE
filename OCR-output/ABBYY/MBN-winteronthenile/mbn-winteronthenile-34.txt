side of the river in case he may want them. We drove out to Kamak to call on Mme. Legrain, who says her husband is nearly dead showing princes and potentates about the ruins. We also called on Mrs. Edgar but didn't see her. When we got back to Luxor cousin Emma came straight home and I paused to refresh myself with tea and Mrs. Pier and to see the throngs at the Winter Palace. Our haughty seclusion on the west bank is well enough in the long run, but I do like once in a while to be in the thick of things.
Friday. February 7. and an almost disagreeable day because of the wind. We meant to ride out to the diggings, but the air was so thick with sand that Doris and I decided to keep to the waterway -so we sailed up the Nile in the little felucca with four of the crew and enjoyed it immensely.
Farewell, dears all. With love and devotion

West Bank, Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- This letter ought really to be skipped and all of you may skip it without hurting my feelings in the very least. Since my last, the Land of Egypt has been the House of Bondage to me - the past week having been an unpleasant medley of broken engagements, frustrated plans, homesickness and sciatica. At least I suppose sciatica is the gentle distemper that makes one's left leg feel as though it had been skinned alive and all the muscles tom out slowly with hot forceps. I've managed not to stay in bed and I've also managed to play dominoes, but I've not been up to anything else, and in my off hours have shut myself up in my room, swathed in knitted things and packed with hot water bags, and saying "Hame, hame, fain wad I be, Hame, hame in my ain countree." To cap the climax we are actually having bad weather. It is now three days since the sunshine has been wholly withdrawn and day before yesterday it actually rained all day; fortunately only a gentle sprinkle - had it been a good New Haven downpour the mud village opposite us would have dissolved before our eyes.
On Monday I was to have gone on a picnic to the Valley of the Queens with the Contessa and Mrs. Pier, but Doris went in my place. On Tuesday I was to have teaed with Mrs. Daniel Eaton, way up the river on the Arabia, but had to send a note saying I was too crippled to come. I hope she will carry out her plan of spending a week on her way down.
The other day Doris rode with Dorothy Richardson over to the abode near Der-el-Bahri which is called indifferently "the American House" or "Mr. Morgan's House", and in which live the men who are managing the Metropolitan excavations, and the wives of said men. When the girls got there at ten o'clock the people were just about to have breakfast! As digging stops at four-thirty they must have a short day at the Metropolitan Concession. Mr. Morgan's eccentric behavior has caused a buzz of comment and conjecture. During the two or three days his dahabya lay here the people at the American House spent their time in moving into tents and back again according to messages from the Great Man as to whether he was or was not going out there to occupy. He finally did not go. He had a party of ten on his boat whom he had invited to go to Khartoum and somehow it leaked out that their lives were a burden to them because their host was so cross and tyrannical. The Khartoum plan was suddenly abandoned and they merely tore up to Aswan and back again, being gone only four days. Then Mr. Morgan engaged suites of rooms at the Winter Palace for his party and before they had time to move into them he whisked them all down to
