Going down the Nile.
Dearest Adeline:- This trip down the Nile, to which we looked forward with such keen pleasure, remembering the rapture of the one up, has been a great disappointment because of the incessant and violent winds. Cousin Emma has scarcely been on deck at all. The rest of us have spent much time there, but usually with a growing irritation at being blown off the map, until the point would be reached when one or all of us would leap out of our chairs with an exasperated "I'm going down - this is too much for me." I can't remember whether I finished my last letter Saturday or Sunday. But anyway I did not tell you, did I, about the lovely walk I had just before sunset and just after on Sunday evening? We tied up a little earlier than usual by a lovely bank, and I started out immediately with Amelie and the usual sailors. We took to what Amelie (who knows this country well) called the highroad. It was literally that, being on sort of an embankment with deep ditches on either side. But it was little more than a footpath winding indefinitely through desert stretches, fascinating villages and cultivated fields, and palm trees scattered almost everywhere. It was such a lovely thing to be doing Palm Sunday, and the whole thing looked as I imagine Palestine.
Yesterday nothing particular occurred except our stopping at Minya for mail. Doris and I walked to the post office with Jones and sailors and then to the railroad station, thereby seeing the main part of the town, which is a flourishing one but not interesting. Today we spent four or five hours a little below Shekh Fadl while the tug coaled. We were tied to a high and very dull bank, and in four or five hours even the ducks can cease to amuse.
Wednesday. March 19. This has been a day. A hideous wind, as usual. Then early this morning we sat on a sandbank for an hour in company with Cook's large steamers, a small steamer and twenty-seven native boats. We were the first to get off and sail away and I suppose they all hated us. For the rest of the day we've played tag with the Arabia and the Rameses III (the two big Cook steamers). They would pass us haughtily, then around a bend in the river we'd find them stuck again and we'd sail by. I don't know how many times that happened. And once when we came upon them stranded and our tug went aground on the same bar for a few minutes, in its frantic struggles to get free it rammed the Rameses, which must have annoyed that monarch greatly. We are tied up tonight about thirty miles from Cairo and a new hat. I hunger and thirst for a new hat. There are no words to express the fatigue that takes possession of me when I don one of my two sun-burned, faded, pinned out, dilapidated head coverings. We are to continue living on the boat for about a week before moving to the Gazireh Palace. It is with a pang that we have today lost sight of the desert, on the edge of which for three months we have lived in a highly civilized and luxurious way - minus, of course, two things that are supposed to go with civilization now. We've not seen a motorcar since leaving Cairo and we couldn't have telephoned anywhere to save our lives!
Thursday. March 20. - Cairo. We started a little before six this morning and were lucky enough to make the bridge just before it closed after the morning opening. If we'd been ten minutes later we would not have got through until afternoon. The wind kept on with unabated zeal but we found the entrance into the city's environs very interesting. I wonder if custom could stale for me the interest, ever. Our tying up place looks perfectly charming - it's the beauty spot of the bank. Not being here to superintend the planting ourselves, our gardener has got that mixture of everything - purple and red and pink - that the Oriental loves, but the effect is gay and springlike,

the grass is very green, there are a few charming flowering shrubs, a palm tree or two, and the steps cut in the bank to the road above have been greatly improved in quality and looks. The gardener himself is a rather dressy looking person with an obsequious grin which I dislike. His subordinate who does the sprinkling is quite unpleasant to look upon - a fat old party dressed in layers of what would seem to be dirty nightshirts, each one shorter than the one underneath it.
We found the flags at half mast and could not learn what for until Jones came back from an expedition into the town and said the poor King of Greece had been murdered.
We have - or are to have tomorrow - the same fine, red motorcar we had before. This afternoon we had to use a substitute when Cousin Theodore, Doris and I motored out to Mena House for tea. The pyramids looked much more impressive to me than the last time. By the way, the stories of Reisner's marvelous find in the Sphynx are mere newspaper inventions. Reisner has been exploring in Dongola all winter - excavating, I mean. It's very amusing to watch the people at Mena House arriving from expeditions on donkey back and camel. When Harry comes down from Luxor he and Doris have planned to go to Sakkara by camel. I am invited but an eight mile ride on a camel when I'm not used to that mode of travel gives me pause. However, I may do it. I'm going to Sakkara, of course somehow.
Good Friday. March 21. Doris wasn't feeling well this morning so I went to church alone, conveyed thither in the bright red car. The chauffeur, a Levantine, I should think, had apparently never heard of the English Church, All Saints, but pretended to understand his instructions, with the result that we wandered aimlessly, though rapidly, about for some time. We got there at last in time. It was a nice and simple service. The church was full - loads of men. On the way out I paused at the end of the church to do homage to the small, plain marble tablet in memory of General Gordon. Outside the door I found Mrs. Romeyn and Estelle waiting for me. I had hoped to see them at church, but had looked in vain. I took them to their hotel, the Continental, and got back to the boat just at luncheon time. This afternoon Cousin Theodore, Doris and I motored out into the desert, the beautiful, haunting desert, and then had tea at Heliopolis. Though we were going rather slowly, for a motor car, we flashed all too rapidly for Doris and me through the streets with their fascinating, fascinating sights. Probably there are places in India where there is the same medley of nationalities as here, but I never imagined anything like it. Our hearts warmed to the sound of the pipes and the sight of a Highlander in kilts.
i -Good-bye, my dears.
Your most devoted Mary

Ghezireh Palace
Dearest Adeline:- The Grand Duchess Constantine and I have been having our clothes made at the same place this week and it has left us little time for our writing. In fact, these past seven days since my last letter have seemed a little too commonplace to be treated in the usual journal way, so I'll give you merely a sort of resume. We moved from the dahabya this morning - it was getting too hot to stay there - and find ourselves in the vast spaces of this palace which once belonged to Ismael. The size of everything is fairly oppressive. Doris and my bedroom is as big as our whole apartment in Orange Street. The bathroom must be thirty feet high (the other rooms of course the same, only it's more apparent in the bathroom) and nailed on the wall, by way of decoration, is a fan whose sticks are a yard long. All through the Palace there are the most superb

mirrors - mirrors everywhere. Ismail's vanity must have been colossal if he liked to see himself at every turn, because his portrait, hanging in the dining salon, is anything but seductive. Our table in said salon is directly next that of the Grand Duke Constantine and their interest in us is much more open than we condescend to let ours in them appear. Tonight at dinner, though they had guests, the Grand Duke kept turning around and staring at us. They evidently knew who Cousin Theodore was. The Grand Duchess looks nice and simple and is very jolly in spite of her fresh mourning for the King of Greece. But the Duke has a fishy eye and a sinister cast of countenance. I wouldn’t care to know him but I'd like very much to meet the Duchess, which I have not done, though the opening sentence of this letter might lead you to suppose that we toddled hand in hand to the tailor's. We were much amused watching the people in the dining room tonight. Really Englishwomen are, this year, even more eccentric than Americans in their coiffures. Mrs. Aylmer, wife of Col. Aylmer, came to dinner in a peacock blue satin bathing cap with rhinestones all around the edge. I wish I had the nerve to do that sort of thing and then I could stop agonizing over my hair.
We truly have done little worth recording this week. It has been very warm - we've had errands to do which have taken time, and when we've simply gone for a drive in the motorcar it has been to no place in particular.
Saturday morning. I'm wondering if you can read this at all - it's written so horribly. I don't know what's got into my penmanship.
Last Sunday being Easter, Doris and I took the precaution of going to church three-quarters of an hour early, and a steady stream of people was entering then. We sat on the side aisle and on the wall before us was a marble tablet Sacred to the Memory of the Riflemen of the 3rd Batallion of the King's Royal Rifles, with its three divisions - Killed in Action, Died of Wounds, and - by far the longest list - Died of Sickness. That seemed to me the most pathetic from its lack of glory, though there may have been quite as much heroism in connection with it as in either of the other two. The church was packed to bursting, and never have those beloved words "Christ is risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept" thrilled me more than in this alien land where the cross with its few thousands towers above the crescent and its millions.
Tuesday morning Harry came down from Luxor and that evening he took Doris and me to the Torchlight Tattoo at the Kaar-el-nil parade ground. It was quite a splendid spectacle. I enclose the programme and beg you of your courtesy to keep it for me. All the performances took place in an immense hollow square, three sides of which were outlined by two hundred Gordon Highlanders each holding a torch. I must confess that the "Grand Military Fantasia - The Battle of Minden" was anything but impressive. I've seen infinitely better sham fights in a Wild West Show. But the rest of it was fine. And "Abide with me" played with a continuous roll of drums for an undertone was one of the most effective things I ever heard. I caught a glimpse of my Russian Princess looking lovelier than ever.
Wednesday morning we all went to the Museum and I was enchanted to find that it was as though scales had fallen from my eyes. Things that had no meaning to me before we went up the river were packed with it this time.
Thursday afternoon Cousin Emma, Doris and Harry went to Shepheard's Hotel and from a balcony witnessed the procession - the bridal procession of the Khedive's daughter. It was short but magnificent. Of course the bride was wholly invisible, being hermetically sealed in a superb mahogany and gold coach with pinky-red velvet hangings, and drawn by six
