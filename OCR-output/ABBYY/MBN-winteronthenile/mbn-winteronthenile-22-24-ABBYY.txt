nature. This afternoon Cousin T., Doris and I took a long ride through larger tracts of cultivated land than we had previously seen. Steam ploughs were at work and the irrigating ditches were cemented and it all looked very modern and progressive and much less interesting and picturesque.
Monday. January 6. This has been a lovely day (of course) but not an eventful one. Doris and I went over to Luxor in the morning and I had electricity applied - with comforting results - to my neuralgic scalp. Then I sat for a little while on the sunny rear terrace of the Winter Palace and talked to Mr. and Mrs. Davenport of Lincoln, Mass., while Doris was talking to some English people on the front terrace. I stayed at home in the afternoon and tried to prolong the life of my stockings, until I had to cram them all into my mending bag on the advent of Baron and Baroness von Bissing and Dr. Hermann Kees for tea. They came along the sands from their dahabya Aziz, which is lying below us on the same side of the river. The Baroness is quite charming and speaks English beautifully. The Baron is a sort of German translation of Leonard Bacon. He pounces on your hand and kisses it, is never still a minute, talks excitedly and amusingly, is immensely clever, gulps down cup after cup of tea and bolts his food with the rapidity of chain lightning. Dr. Kees may be and probably is possessed of vast learning, but he is afraid to speak English which he evidently understands, and his appearance is all that there is of callowness - he looks as though "de eggshell not yet off is back".
Wednesday. January 8. Yesterday was a day too crowded for any epistolary efforts on my part.
It began immediately after breakfast with a call from a sailing dahabya which, from lack of wind, had paused just above us. Its occupants, a Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence and a Mr. and Mrs. Pope, were crazy to meet Cousin Theodore, so they called. We liked them. They were very "plain Americans" from Ohio, and took liberties with our mother tongue, but they were awfiilly nice.
Mr. Pope explained to me apologetically that he knew nothing whatever about Egyptian things as he "never had been a historian". When they had departed we, all four, went across the river in the felucca, the others stopping at Mr. Nicolls' dahabya to see his lovely pictures, and I going on to Luxor for a fitting of a blouse which is being made for me by a person who advertises herself as "Ancient dressmaker to the Queen of Holland".
Harry Burton came over from the valley and lunched with us and in the afternoon we all proceeded to Medinet Habu to gaze upon the site where Cousin T. means to dig next. The others rode, but Cousin Emma and I drove in a sand cart, a low hung, one-seated, two-wheeled cart, the tires of the wheels being as broad as those of a motor car. A white mule was our steed, I held the reins, and the driver and one of our sailors careered along beside us. I thought it was fun. Cousin Emma thought it was awful, and vowed that never again would she get into that kind of vehicle.
It is the Coptic ruins adjoining Medinet Habu that we mean to excavate, and while we were wandering about the appalling masses of debris a strong wind sprang up, and we got a taste of what a sandstorm can be like. We made a frantic dash for home, and through a misunderstanding Doris got left behind, and when I discovered it I had five thousand fits. When we reached the dahabya Jones' stem inquiry "Where is Miss Doris?" was the final straw. I'm afraid my voice rose almost to a shriek as I said "Nobi wouldn't dare not to take care of her!" (Nobi is her donkey boy.) A sailor was instantly dispatched on a steed and Doris says he nearly rent Nobi limb from limb when he finally met them, and it was in no way poor Nobi's fault.
Baths and evening clothes restored our poise, and Doris and I made our first plunge into Luxor society. Mr. and Mrs. Garret Pier, fascinating Americans stopping at the Winter Palace, had invited us to dine and stay for a dance. And what an entrancing way to go to dinner! We stepped
19
into the immaculate felucca, and skimmed down the starlit river, with six white turbans bowing rythmically before us as the men bent to their oars. Two of them, carrying lanterns, escorted us from the landing to the hotel entrance and we found them standing like statues awaiting us when we re-emerged in the middle of the night. We had a lovely time. Doris was much entertained by amusing young Englishmen, some of whom danced well, and I enjoyed myself enormously talking to some people and watching others. The Contessa was there looking as ghastly as a clown at a circus. "They say" that last year she had yellow hair and a red face. This year she is in mourning for her divorced husband (who was, very properly, shot a short time ago) so now her hair is black and her face whitewashed. A young Englishman, who evidently hates her, told Doris that she was the deplorable kind of elderly female who loves to have a phalanx of boys about her. As I'm that kind myself I'm beginning to think I may like her when I really know her. She has invited me to ride with her some time.
This afternoon Doris and I rode to our beloved Kamak. All Luxor watched our start and small wonder, for there were nine men - six of the crew, two donkey boys and Jones trying to saddle Sugar to suit me. This sounds as though I were getting fussy but I'm not. It's only that Sugar has such a small tummy that it seems impossible to cinch a side saddle to him securely, and it's misery to ride on a turned saddle. Later Cousin Emma and I teaed on the Aziz with the Von Bissings, whose table fairly tottered under the weight of things to eat.
Thursday. January 9. A perfectly delicious day - it really has seemed to me the best air we've had yet. Doris and I had a heavenly time this morning. We rode out to the Ramesseum starting early and taking only Nobi and Malimond with us. It was lovely there - in a way I liked it better than any of the ruins we've seen - there were no tourists, no excavating going on - just silence and remoteness and sunshine and the mighty past. Mr. Nicoll came over this afternoon late to say goodbye. He starts back to England tomorrow. We hear Lord Kitchener was in Luxor this afternoon. So near and I didn't see him! I have said - and believed I meant it - that there wasn't a man in the world who could make me marry him, but if Lord Kitchener proposes to me I shall undoubtedly accept him.
Friday. January 10. An exciting note from Harry this morning before breakfast saying that he has unearthed a red granite sarcophagus, that the lid has fallen off, top downward, but evidently has a recumbent figure carved upon it, and that it will take him about two days to remove the debris in which it is embedded. Cousin Theodore has lost all interest in the tomb of Siphtah, for some incomprehensible reason, and when he came in to breakfast and I said "Isn't it thrilling about the sarcophagus?" he merely said "Ha!" But later he announced that he thought he'd ride over to the valley tomorrow and take Doris with him - adding that he didn't think that the discovery of the sarcophagus would prove to be of the least importance. Doris went to ride by herself this afternoon, with a nautical escort, on the other side of the river and I took a walk with Cousin Theodore on the sands. In one place where there were some damp hollows about 40 or 50 wagtails were apparently playing a game. It was charming to watch. They would jump into the air and land lightly again with a little flutter of wings, run a few steps and then jump into the air.
It was actually a gray afternoon with a heavy and depressing atmosphere. The Von Bissings lunched with us. The Baron's descriptions of things are unique. He was telling about a tree he had seen in the morning that was "entirely ill and losing all its sings"! The Baroness says their little girl (at home in Munich) always prefers to speak English "because" the child says "to speak German makes me so hot!" I think that's a perfect description of the effect on one of a difficult tongue.
Goodbye for this time, my dears all
Your devoted Mary

Monday. January 13. 1913.
West Bank, Luxor
Dearest Adeline;- Cousin Theodore and Doris are just back from the valley, having, like the unreliable persons they are, stayed two days and nights when they said they would only be away one. Doris is wild about the sarcophagus, and they both went into the tomb and saw it, though Cousin Emma and I had given them cast iron orders not to, fearing it would cave in on them and we miles away. The sarcophagus is of red granite, is 10 ft. 3 in. long, 5ft. 3 in. wide, and 4 ft. 8 in. deep. It is covered with inscriptions and bears the cartouches of Siphtah. It is apparently in a perfect state of preservation. The lid, which is lying beside it, face downward is 1 ft. 10 in. thick, and evidently has a recumbent figure carved upon it. By lying on her tummy Doris managed to see the two great feathers, part of a wig and one ear. Everyone of us is now agonizing for fear the nose is broken. The sarcophagus is filled with debris and we don't yet know whether it contains anything of value. A lot of broken alabaster objects have been unearthed in one comer of the chamber, and Doris is the ostentatious owner of a small alabaster head with a lovely face which she saw dug out. Isn't it gorgeous that we are here with things like that happening?
I was so anxious to hear their tidings (as well as needing exercise) that I started out on foot this afternoon hoping to meet them. Once in a while I do like to take a walk by myself, so I tried to slip off without being seen. But the eagle eye of the ferocious second captain detected me, and in three minutes I was being escorted by Sala, of the crew, with his heavy stick in his hand. We ploughed through the sand till we reached the little path running through cultivated stretches, then at right angles along the broader path which answers for a highway and is ankle deep in dust, and where I had to sidestep donkeys laden with sugarcane and camels with mounted police; this for a long distance till I came to a tiny mud village with an encircling wall, from the top of which a yellow dog desired greatly to hurl himself on top of my hat, then under some fine lebbek trees, across a bridge an up on the embankment overlooking the vast plain where the Colossi sit forever in state. There were hordes of people donkeying along (tourists mostly) but my party were nowhere in sight so I turned around and came back again. I think white women never walk here, except along the waterfront at Luxor, and if I'd been "a efflant" or a rhinoceros I could hardly have attracted more attention. It has been a grey day and I've resented it most unreasonably. One really ought to be able to bear one grey day out of forty sunshiny ones, particularly when reading the newspaper accounts of the frightful weather at home. I am so sorry and so concerned for you all.
The Fahnstocks of New York and Newport have tied up in their Dahabya Cheops just to the rear of us and their washing and ours have been flapping on the sands in sweet accord all day.
Tuesday. January 14. Harry Burton came over from the valley early (Tuesday is his holiday) and he and Doris and I crossed over to Luxor, they to wander among the beauties of Luxor and I to be prosaically shampooed. The morning was so gorgeous I hated to spend it that way. Harry lunched with us on the Beduin and when he had, later, turned his donkey's nose toward the valley and Cousin Theodore had arisen from his nap, the latter gentleman,
Doris and I rowed over to the Luxor landing, mounted our donkeys and started up the river - a ride new to me, though the others had taken it once before. But we had barely started when Sugar's conduct became unfit for print. He nearly threw me down an embankment, he brayed in a manner that out-Juliused Julius, and I simply got off and refused ever to ride him again. The others rode on and I descended the bank and sat in the felucca until they returned.
