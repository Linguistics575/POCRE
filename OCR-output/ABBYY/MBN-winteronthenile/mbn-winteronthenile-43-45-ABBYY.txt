wind, a turbulent river and a thick grey atmosphere. We passed a mile of flamingoes standing in serried ranks upon the sands, and it was a marvelous sight, though owing to the mistiness of the morning we could not see their color. It was very cold and the land looked very dreary and nowhere as beautiful as at Luxor. We arrived at luncheon time and wound a tortuous way among the titanic chaos of strange rocks that break the channel here, until we found a tying up place by a little sandy island opposite the Cataract Hotel and near Elephantine. We cavalierly pushed a small fishing fleet out of the cove we wanted, and if the language was as lurid as it was loud they must have "cursed us out" quite thoroughly. The ducks nearly died with rapture when their coop was opened and the river was once more theirs. And the chicken boy was kept busy tearing over to other coves to shoo them back. Sir Francis and his ladies are bom explorers.
After luncheon Doris and I, with Amelie, Haneen and a sailor to see that nobody stole us, went over (via the felucca) to the town and walked along the waterfront which is in itself much more attractive than the one at Luxor. And the whole region is much more strange and wild and savage, though much less majestically beautiful. The sun had come out, the air was fine and bracing and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. To see the bazaar was what we really went for and we were mad about it - not nearly so large of course as the one at Cairo, but - like the country -so strange and savage with such bewildering things for sale - most of which we wanted. The leopard skins filled me with covetousness, but are very expensive. I envied a Frenchman who had a beauty under his arm as he stood bargaining for a stuffed crocodile. Haneen is an admirable adjunct to shopping in the bazaars. He laughs sardonically whenever a merchant mentions a price and if we really want the article he jabbers something in the vernacular, thrusts half the sum demanded into the outstretched hand, and walks off with the amber beads or the dervish knife or the Soudanese basket, and is allowed to go in peace. It's very cold here and we expected to sizzle with heat.
Thursday. March 5. Today Doris and I saw one of the wonders of the world - the great Aswan Dam, which seemed to me an incredible achievement of engineering. We started immediately after breakfast, taking a carriage at the Cataract Hotel, and with Haneen to carry our wraps and the luncheon basket and do our talking. We plunged almost instantly from that highly civilized hotel courtyard and gardens into an utterly desperate desert - a truly terrible place with none of the beauty of the desert at Luxor. The ruined little habitations, the ruined little cemeteries, the strange rocks with inscriptions scattered here and there, only added in my eyes to the general horror of the desolation. There were about three miles of that and then, again with complete abruptness, we found ourselves in a charming little oasis of a compound, with neat and pretty bungalows, lovely trees and gardens and verdant terraces - the little village where the government employees connected with the dam live. We walked across the barrage, a mile and a quarter, and the little talking we did was done in exclamations. On one side, within eight feet of the top of the barrage, lay the Nile in a placid lake. On the other, at least a hundred feet below, through a very few of the 180 sluices the water thundered and leapt and boiled almost like Niagara at the base of the falls, and then spread itself out in many streams that flowed among the numberless wild masses of strange rocks that make up the riverbed in that region. And stretching on all sides the sand ridges of that fearful desert, sinister and with a look of eternal doom - the very edge of Savage Africa.
At the far end of the barrage we took a crazy little felucca and sailed to Philae. Alas for that poor, drowned "Pearl of Egypt"! We stepped out of our boat on to the roof of the temple, the tops of a few palm trees were apparently floating on the water which lapped the very capitals of the columns of that perfect kiosk. A keening and wailing came from one of the islands, and boats were hastening towards it filled with women who looked like black crows. Haneen said there was
40
"died man" on the island. We had to row back as the two men managing the boat were afraid to sail her in a fierce and contrary wind, which incidentally fairly blew our luncheon out of our mouths. It was such heart-breaking work, the rowing, that I made the men land us on a sandy point some distance from our destination. And I would not have missed a close inspection of that sand for much. It was turquoise blue and golden yellow. I don't expect to be believed, and if Doris hadn't seen it too, I would have thought I had gone color mad. We came home in a boat rowed by savages, one of whom beat upon a drum made of a hide stretched over a broken water jar, and sang wild ditties of his tribe I should imagine. The tiller of the boat was managed by a black baby aged about five. Shortly after we started on our downward voyage there shot out from a cove three tiny boats made of tin, in each of which sat a coal black little boy, two of whom were naked and the third jauntily attired in a turban and very short waistcoat. They paddled their crafts with tin disks, one in each hand. They pursued us madly demanding backshish, which of course they got. It has been a marvelous expedition.
Thursday. March 6. The wind apparently blows all the time at Aswan and dries one up so you have to use pounds of cold cream. We shifted our position this morning, leaving the channel between Elephantine and the Cataract House, and moving over to the other side of Elephantine and tying up opposite the Grenfell tombs. The felucca took us over there after luncheon - Doris and me - and two of the sailors helped us to climb the rather terrific flight of steps to the tombs. The tombs are so simple and crude and archaic and different that we found them very interesting. But the glorious views we had afterwards interested me much more. We live so low down in our dahabya that I'm beginning to have a frantic craving for heights. So, the tombs duly visited, we went on with our climbing. Doris and her sailor climbed to the very top and saw "hundreds of miles" she said - off over the desert. My left leg still being somewhat stiff I stopped when part way up and sat on a ruined wall on a spur of the hill and gazed down upon river and town and desert, many sunburned naked native towns, one perfectly superb sycamore tree, a train of camels on a beach near the steamer landing, and a fleet of snowy sails racing down the Nile. We were sorry we didn't stay longer, for when back on the Beduin the wind made the deck untenable and drove us below. We are off early tomorrow morning without having set foot on Elephantine! I rejoice to think of the long river trip before we finally reach Cairo.
Love and love and love, my dears
Your devoted Mary
Sunday. March 9.
West Bank at Luxor again.
Dearest Adeline:- Here we are once more, not exactly in the old spot, because we found that usurped by an English dahabya - so we had to tie up a couple of boat lengths above. We arrived about 10:30 this morning and it is all so beautiful. Doris and I love this part of the river much more than those wild a lonely stretches near Aswan, and nowhere since we left here, eight days ago, have we seen anything as superb as the Libyan Range. We left Aswan early Friday morning with optimistic expectations of a smooth and rapid trip, having the current with us to aid our good little tug. But it was a case of sitting on sandbars every little while, with a head wind that was a gale and so heavy a "sea" on that it actually got too exciting, and so we sought as sheltered a spot as we could find and tied up about luncheon time in wait till the wind should fall. I took a walk early in the afternoon but Doris declared such a proceeding much too energetic for her. Through Haneen, as interpreter, I announced to the Rais (Arabic for Captain) that as I was only going to walk on the sands on the river's edge I did not want a sailor, and on I went. After walking some distance a slight sound made me look behind and there was the dandy of the crew (he who buys a
41
new set of rings every other week to wear upon his tattooed hands) dogging my steps.
Discovered, he drew nearer and practiced his English upon me. From his mutilated utterances I gleaned that his name was Mourse, that his home was Cairo, and that I was a nice lady. There was no village in sight but a flock of brown sheep were feeding on the herbage upon the slope near the river, and were being minded by a group of women and some little children who said "How-do, how-do" as I passed by. Coming back the wind was against us and I reached the Beduin in a state of heat and fatigue, and with that sense of virtue that one has after having taken a walk one didn't want to take. The wind fell late in the afternoon and we went a few miles farther down before tying up for the night near Silaileh. Yesterday a sandbar and the bridge at Esneh furnished our chief excitements. The sandbar held us fast for an hour or more, and it was amusing to watch the various tactics employed to get us afloat. Once some of the crew took off their turbans, stripped to the waist, went into the river and set their splendid shoulders against the boat (the Beduin herself actually got stuck that time) and pushed. It's queer, but these men look much more undressed without their turbans than without their clothes.
At the Esneh bridge we cut loose temporarily from our tug and were warped through, stem first, with ropes, the tug following; and so avoided a repetition of the accident going up. We tied up for the night on the east bank opposite a small town some distance above Erment. Coming down from there this morning it was perfectly lovely. We got here too late to go to church, and I've not been off the boat all day. Doris went this afternoon for a last look at Kamak.
Monday. March 10. Our hours here are numbered and I feel as though I couldn't let them go.
For some reason it's nice to be departing - for we are really now turning our faces homeward and there are Italy and England to be taken in by the way, but there's so much here that I've not really seen - and the place itself is so hauntingly beautiful. I thank Heaven that mine eyes have seen it. Cousin Theodore and Doris went for one more ride this afternoon, but I had to do the society act for the family - going out to say good-bye to the teachers at the Mission School, and then to tea with the Contessa. That poor lady, instead of going to Cairo immediately after our departure for Aswan - as she intended - was ill in bed for a week and looks quite shocking. We had a charming time together and tea out in the garden. She says that Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, says that our finds this winter have been the only ones of any importance in this region. The men at the American House (i.e., the Metropolitan Museum diggers) have found nothing but trifles like beads, etc. Lord Carnarvon and his digger - the captious Mr. Howard Carter - have been working like mad for weeks without stopping at all for the weekly holiday, and with a force of 300, and have found nothing. "And Carnarvon bears it", says Mr. Tremaine, who has somehow been completely hypnotized by that degenerate peer, "as only Carnarvon could!" Having lofty souls ourselves we are sorry the others have been unsuccessful, but considering how Howard Carter sneered to us one day about Harry Burton's capacity as a digger, we are too enchanted that it was Harry who made the important finds, and Harry himself is so happy he looks like a different man.
Tuesday. March 11. And our last day at Luxor - a perfectly beautiful one like so many, many that have preceded it. Harry came over from the valley quite early to spend the day and make his final report about the diggings which closed down yesterday. He stopped work ad Medinet Habu a week ago, and spent the final week clearing up things in Siphtah where he found alabaster fragments which, when pieced together, made 18 Ushabti! He presently crossed over to Luxor to pick up Cousin Emma and Doris who had gone there, and at luncheon time they had much tittle-tattle to communicate. They had encountered the youngest son of the German Emperor, and Doris was rejoicing that she was not a Royal Prince, if they looked like that - with positively no chin at all.
