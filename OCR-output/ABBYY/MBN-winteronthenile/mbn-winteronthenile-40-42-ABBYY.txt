Friday. February 28. And our last day here until we stop on our way down to Cairo. I went across to Luxor this morning to say good-bye to Mrs. Pier and have a final scalp treatment. The tonic they apply is made, they say, from the juice of the palm tree. This morning when the German youth who has had recent charge of my sparse tresses dabbed on said tonic, I exclaimed "Oh! that stings!" "Yes, madam, it is de stink of de palm" was his apt rejoinder.
Cousin Emma and I had a wondrous drive this afternoon. Neither she nor I had been to the diggings at Medinet Habu for weeks. When we announced we were going Cousin T. said he did not wish us to as we would interfere with the work. He and Doris go over every other day, but when we suggest going he seems to think that our presence will block everything. We took the felucca and rowed down to the ferry landing where a carriage with two mules awaited us, and I was internally much amused when Cousin Emma gave the driver the simple order "Medinet Habu", for the Valley of the Queens was supposed to be our object. But we were crazy to see the things Harry had excavated since our last visit - namely the palace of Rameses III. We found Harry trying to take a photograph, while his hundred boys and men proceeded on their endless procession to the dumping place. The throne room and three bathrooms are what have, thus far, been brought to light. As the bathrooms open directly off the throne room, to the casual and frivolous eye it would seem that the king divided his time between sitting on his throne and a-washing of hisself. On our way to our carriage we were held up by a native who produced a bandana tied up in a wad from which he took out four little carved bone images, which he told us, in a scared whisper, came from Lord Carnarvon's diggings. Cousin Emma wished to buy them for Doris, but had forgotten her purse. The man agreed to take the entire contents of mine, though it fell short of the ten shillings he asked. When too late we realized that this transaction left us with no backshis for anybody. On we went to the Valley of the Queens - a lovely desert drive, and to my eye a much happier valley than that of the Kings, because of the wide and beautiful view from its entrance away down to the river and on to the far Arabian Mts. On our arrival at the tombs and upon being confronted by the gaffir, we remembered we'd left our passes at home. But the magic name of Davis opened the way. But then we fell back in the carriage explaining we had no backshis. Broad smiles on the face of the gaffir and a courteous assurance that that made no difference. I wanted mainly to see the tomb of Nefertari so I went into that, and if that Queen was as lovely as her pictures on those walls, Rameses II must have been crazy about her.
The drive back to the river was enchanting - the air so fresh, so calm, so scented, the barley fields such a rejoicing green, everything so beautiful in the ecstatic light of afternoon. The river reached, no backshis for the driver, but he was quite satisfied when we told him Mr. Jones would attend to that (Jones is almost as much a name to conjure by as Davis. Also there was no felucca, we having forgotten to tell it when to come back for us!
A Winter Palace boat clamored for the honor of taking us to our dahabya, brutally pushing aside one lone tourist wishing to cross to said Palace. Just started in the Winter Palace boat, up dashed our own felucca, the men rowing like mad, and we were transferred, the Winter Palace boatmen perfectly satisfied when we said Mr. Jones would see them. The whole expedition was awfully amusing.
Saturday. On our way up the River. We "hit the trail" (as we used to say in my beloved wild west) at 7:20 this morning, and it was high time for us to be moving, for Cousin Theodore was getting tired of Luxor and very low in his mind. And again Doris and I are in the clutch of the enchantment of these wonderfiil shores slipping by us. Everybody is planting melons, even on the sandbars in the middle of the river. I should think that later on the entire population would be writhing with colic.

I don't know just where this will be posted but it will seize its first opportunity.
Much, much love to you all.

Saturday. March 2.
The Nile, Somewhere above Edfu
Dearest Adeline:- If the frogs made as much noise in Pharoah's bedroom as they are making outside of mine tonight I wonder he did not let the people go sooner. I never heard anything like it. And just this minute the voice of a jackal was added to the row that has been going on every second since 6:30 - it now being half-past ten.
Yesterday, after I finished my letter to you, we had an excitement. We were going through the great bridge at Esneh when our tug made too sharp a turn before the dahabya got clear of the tremendous piers or buttresses or whatever they are called. Everybody up above on the bridge watching our transit began to jump and yell, the crew came flying up on deck like the wind and leaped like cats on the railing to try to push us off as we rounded and crashed against the buttress. Second Captain Mahommed, as he flung his whole weight on his tiller, looked like a raging devil - and undoubtedly has one inside of himself. There was not much damage done - some paint removed and a few splinters, but that was all. And none of the crew hurt - to our great relief -1 thought one man was going to be mashed.
The rest of the afternoon's voyage "up south" as they say in this land of contradictions, proceeded in peace with such exquisite beauty round about us that I wished I had been constructed "full of eyes before and behind" like the Beast in Revelations. The ineffable light and color filled the very air - like music. One new feature in the landscape was the stockade-like structures made of dry stalks (stalks of the dhurra, I fancy) put down along the sunny side of the shadufs to protect the workers a little from the glare. We must have passed hundreds of shadufs yesterday and today. They must weaken the bank greatly. This morning we heard a piece of the bank detach itself with a boom like a cannon and drop into the Nile. We stopped at Edfu today so that Doris and I might see the temple. We started this morning from our tying up place (the other side of El Kab) before sunrise, but ran on to a sandbar and were much delayed, and it was luncheon time when we reached Edfu. As soon as we had lunched Doris and I started, climbing a very steep and dusty bank, covered with chicken feathers, at the top of which donkeys were awaiting us. Just how it is managed to always have donkeys or carriages ready for us I don't know, but it always is. It's Jones, I suppose. Beside the usual foot escort of donkey boys and a sailor we had a mounted one consisting of Haneen and a native policeman. There was nothing attractive about the ride, which took only ten or fifteen minutes, and the heat was fierce. But the temple is perfectly stunning; probably the best preserved ancient monument in the world, Baedecker says. The gaffir who showed us over the temple explained that its excellent state was due to its being "so modern" -dating from 237 B.C! In one of the ten small chambers opening from the corridor surrounding the Sanctuary is a granite sacrificial stone and he told us a tale concerning it which we can find in none of the guide books. He said that upon that stone were slain such people as were unfortunate enough to have one red lock of hair among the dusky ones. "If man have one lock red hair he bad man" he said. We saw the Nilometer outside the temple and we climbed to the roof of the temple, where it was hotter than pepper but the view from which made it quite worth while.
The donkey I rode was the most heavenly animal I've ever been on - a big, handsome grey Sudanese donkey with a gait so smooth he hardly seemed to be moving. I would like nothing

better than to buy him and take him home. Conventions are such deadly stupid things - Doris and Roger would almost as soon have me dead as to see me riding about New Haven on a donkey covered with red tassels, and yet it would give me such keen pleasure and be such pleasant, moderate exercise. We got back to the Beduin at three and proceeded upon our lovely, watery way.
Monday. March 3. It has been a perfectly horrid day with a lovely ending to it, and just one pleasant incident in the horrid part. No sooner had we started this morning than we stuck on a sandbar - that is, our tug stuck. As the Beduin draws only 14 inches of water she never sticks on anything. When we finally got off there were five other boats (native ones - high and dry on the same bar. It was a grey morning and the air heavy and enervating. As we went through the gorge of Silsileh we had an excellent view of the rock-hewn chapel ofHorem-heb with its five doors and that curious row of shrines, also rock-hewn, with the figures in them looking, as Miss Edwards says in her "Thousand Miles up the Nile", like people sitting in opera boxes. And then a perfectly dreadful wind blew up and lashed the river into a fury of waves and whitecaps, and the air was full of sand and the landscape was more or less blotted out, and every bit of energy evaporated from me. At about one we tied up just above Kom Ombo, both because Doris and I were to see the temple, and also because navigation was too disagreeable.
There is a bank towering above us here where we are tied, and though the Beduin jerked and strained most of the afternoon, we were out of the direct path of the wind. Doris and I decided to wait till after tea before going to the temple, in hopes that the wind would fall - which it did. The one pleasant incident above referred to was a visit from a tiny black kid with long flopping white ears. He announced himself with some baby bleats and then trotted across the gangplank on to the lower deck. We went out to see him, and he liked us so much that he kept coming back every time the sailors herded him off the gang plank to the shore.
After tea Doris and I took Haneen and a sailor, climbed the bank, and two minutes walk along the top of it brought us to the temple. The hour we spent there put us in tune again. It has the unusual interest of being a duplex temple. If you drew a line straight through the center from front to back you would have on each side of that line a complete temple with forecourt, hypostile halls (large and small), vestibules, sanctuary and chambers, and the one on the right hand side is dedicated to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk; and on the left, to Homar or Horceris (the Elder Horns). The first thing we saw on entering the forecourt was a little chapel in one room of which is a pile of mummied crocodiles - quite shuddery. The temple is veiy ruinous, and the reliefs, carved over every inch of it have departed from the pure, conventional lines of the best Egyptian art and go in for realism with a result that is rather fat and unpleasant. Its chief glory in our eyes is its site - directly on the edge of the Nile on the summit of a bank so lofty that it would be a cliff if it were of rock, but being of earth, has had to be strongly reinforced to keep the whole temple from gradually washing away at the time of the inundation. The views from the interior, out through the splendid columns, of the river and the limitless desert beyond, are a wonder and a joy. We climbed far up on a ruined pylon and sat there watching the gleaming river far below, the wisteria tint spreading over the sands of an island now void of the crocodiles that once infested it, a long line of people going home to a village on the far shore, and then the sun sinking behind the dim, dim, distant ridges of my beloved Libyan Mountains. And with the sinking of the sun the cloudy sky flamed into splendor. Somehow it all made me think of "the glory that was Greece" quite as much as of the brutal majesty that was Egypt.
Tuesday. March 4. Aswan. We did not spend the night on the pylon, though I see I made no mention of our coming down. We left Kom Ombo before we were up this morning, in a heavy
