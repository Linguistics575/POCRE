we again passed the patriotic display of bunting that adorable Eleanor Pier, aged seven, said "Whose birthday is this? Did you say it was President Taft's?"
The Dodges joined me at the Winter Palace and we had tea on the rear terrace, and it was awfully nice to be with friends from my native state. Doris and Janet Dodge had spent the whole morning together at Kamak, so Doris thought she would better ride to the diggings with Cousin T. instead of coming to tea.
Now I'm going to wind up with two nice, appropriate little tales. Two or three years ago when on the 22nd of February the Beduin was in her gala dress to do honor to the day, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, coming down the river from Aswan, thought it was in their honor, and did everything except fire a salute to express their appreciation of the attention! And once in the days when my relatives had that superb dragoman Mohammed Sala (that was before Jones had qualified as a dragoman) he was much offended that he had not been informed the day beforehand that this important anniversary was pending. Hearing someone say at the breakfast table "This is Washington's Birthday - the boat must be dressed", he hurried out. Returning he said to Cousin Emma "Madam, the cook say it is not possible to prepare a fitting luncheon for the day without some notice." "I didn't want a special luncheon - the cook gives us too much to eat always, as it is", said Madam. At the close of luncheon, entered Mohammed Sala, bearing a colossal cake with the American flag in colored frosting on it. He placed it on the table and with a look of deep reproach at Cousin Emma, he announced "Le gateau pour Mr. Washington!" I had the pleasure of seeing Mohammed Sala today. On getting into the felucca after leaving the Winter Palace, the men held it while beckoning and calling to someone on the neighboring boat. Then Sala came hurrying along the bank, stepped into the felucca and bowed low over my hand. He said he was here "with one prince". After an exchange of compliments he departed. He is usually with important people. He was twice with the Empress of Austria, and she nearly killed him walking out to the Pyramids from Cairo and back every morning before breakfast.
Goodnight, dears all.

Dearest Adeline:- The Contessa and I had planned to go on a picnic a deux to the tombs of the Nofiles today, but at breakfast time a boat brought a note saying a heavy cold on her chest prevented her going. As I had on my hateful riding things (never donned except for my donkey) I decided to take a ride anyway. Neither Doris nor Cousin Theodore would go with me, so I went alone, quite thrilled because it was the first time in fifteen days that I had ridden. It was the dullest ride I ever had. Wadi Haifa needed the inspiration of others of his kind. We started off with Malimond tugging at his head and a sailor pushing from behind. Shouts, duckings, gurglings had no effect whatever on him. Whacks simply made his hindquarters go suddenly sideways in the disconcerting movement that almost unseats me. It took me an hour to get out to the Colossi, so there I turned about, relinquishing the Valley of the Queens for which I was headed and which I've not yet seen. If Malimond and the sailor had even talked to each other it would have been less depressing. I kept getting sadder and sadder and Egypt began to seem to me a lonely land of Doom, when I was suddenly cheered by the sight of a camel loaded with trunks and making for the American House. A camel can always pluck me out of melancholy. It was very hot coming home and I had to keep my veil down to prevent breathing tiny black flies.

This afternoon Cousin Emma and I, in response to the Contessa's importunities, went over and teaed with her in the Luxor Hotel gardens. She was very hoarse and the ground was very damp, but the sunshine lovely, the tea delicious and there were three other guests, quite charming - Lady Baring, Mrs. Murray and the Countess Pauline Pappenheim. I talked to the latter all the time, and I'm thankful I don't fall in love with men as easily as I do with women. The Countess Pauline is a girl after my own heart - about Doris's age, I should think, and with a very noble sort of beauty, and too sweet. She told me she was half American - that her mother was a Philadelphian, but I don't know who. And all this time I've been skipping yesterday which may be briefly summarized as follows:
The boisterous Mr. Whymper came to breakfast. (I've decided all that excitable volubility is his company manner, because when he crosses over with Doris and me in the felucca on our way to church he is quite pleasantly quiet, and his face in repose is sad.) I went to church and after service had a little talk with Mrs. Daniel Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle for whom I waited outside the door. Brought Mr. and Mrs. Pier home with me for luncheon. They grow more and more delightful. Two English ladies came to tea - Mrs. Morhouse, hushed and gentle and sweet - and Mrs. Aylmer, who might easily be colonel of a regiment. I believe her husband is. Yesterday was the warmest day we've had, I think, and today there has been a touch of Khamseen - the hot, thick wind of Egypt. It made the sunset tonight one of opaque, almost suffocating gold.
Tuesday. February 25. The comings and goings today have been crowded. Doris and I dashed across the river immediately after breakfast to buy Soudanese beads together, and then I dashed back again, leaving her to play with Dorothy Richardson. Just after I returned to the Beduin, Harry arrived for his holiday, courteously wearing the necktie I crocheted for his Christmas present. He presently crossed over to have his hair cut and pick up Doris. I was in the middle of a game of dominoes when I heard a voice on the land side of us demanding "Is anybody at home? Is anybody at home? Is Mrs. Newberry in?" and Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle descended from a sand cart and entered via the gangplank. They'd been to the Ramesseum - or somewhere.
A brief visit and they departed after I'd shown them over the dahabya. Then Harry and Doris came. Luncheon next. After which the two young people went for a sail. About 4 P.M. who should arrive - taking my breath away with the violence of the surprise - but Karl Weston (Professor of Romance Languages at Williams) whom I last saw twelve years ago when we took tea together in a chestnut tree at that queer place "Robinson" outside of Paris. Close on heels came Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson, who had been asked to tea. Cousin Theodore went below and couldn't see anybody. Then at 7:15 Doris, in her war paint, went across the river to dine and dance at the Winter Palace - so it's been almost as hectic as some of the days at home...Doris just back at 11.30 and says she Bostoned most of the evening with Newton Byers - of 1912 Sheff. - and saw the family of that Perfect Beauty, Radcliffe Romeyn, 1912 Captain of the Yale Crew.
Wednesday. February 26. I called this afternoon on the Romeyns on their steamer and was very glad to see them, but was freshly impressed with how awful it would be to go about in a Cook's party - infinitely better though than not to go at all. Mrs. Romeyn said she had almost despaired of seeing us because the only information Radcliffe could give her of our whereabouts when she bade him good-bye, was that we "were travelling with some big bug on a private dahabya that tied up anywhere it pleased along the Nile". They go on to Aswan tomorrow. I teaed at the Winter Palace with Mr. Weston and had a lovely time. That is a most congenial young man, and it seems absurd, when he lives in Williamstown and we in New Haven, that we should meet only once in ten years or so in the top of chestnut trees in Paris, or at Hundred Gated Egyptian Thebes.

I wonder if it's often given to human eyes to see anything more beautiful than the Libyan Range was to mine as I saw it from the front terrace of the Winter Palace today in all the splendor and the glamour of the late afternoon light. It strikes me with fresh joy every time I look at it from that particular place and at that hour. The Beduin has sunk so with the falling river that from the salon we can no longer see even the tip-top of the Range, and even from the upper deck we do not get it in its full majesty as they do from the Winter Palace. When we first tied up here we could see the Range and all the intervening stretch of desert and green from the salon window -which will give you some idea of how the river has dropped.
When I got back to the Beduin I found Mrs. Pier and the Countess having tea. They had stopped on their way home from an all day expedition to the Valley of the Tombs of the Apes. They had asked Doris and me to go, but we declined because Cousin T. was not feeling well.
Thursday. February 27. This morning Cousin Emma and Doris went over to Luxor to see Mohammed Mohassib and the Luxor temple, etc. while Cousin Theodore and I settled ourselves with the dominoes on deck. In the middle of a game the sound of many bleats arose upon the air -ranging from deep paternal ones to tiny appealing baby calls, and over the sands came a flock of dark brown sheep with four men and some children shepherding them. They came straight to the little cove just at the stern of the Beduin. Three of the men stripped to the loincloth, and each grabbed a sheep and walked into the river to wash it, while the children and the fourth man kept the rest of the flock together, and one small naked boy wrestled with a ram. It was a very interesting sight and I was so annoyed when the native policeman, who spends his day over here to see that no one steals our turkeys, strolled up and ordered them away from the sacred precincts of the dahabya.
This afternoon Doris and Cousin Theodore rode over to the diggings and I went for a long walk. My Monday attempt proved that my leg is still too lame for riding. Away to the north, standing in a row in the most obvious and posterish manner, with the far end of the Range as a background, are three palm trees. They look exactly like the funny pictures of the African desert with an artist up in one of them while a lion lashes his tail in front of a deserted easel below. Cousin Emma says she has hated those palm trees for years, and even I have got deadly tired of them this winter. So I walked to them to see if I liked them better at close range. The first part of the walk led along the sands by the river's edge where the natives are planting their melons. Vast stretches of little hillocks, with short bunches of dry cane in them to keep the sand together, show where melons have already been planted, and little oblong bunches, about the size of a large watermelon, show where others are to be planted. There ought to be an enormous crop in this immediate vicinity alone. Then I struck inland past a native village which has always looked so charming in the distance and which was very squalid really. Along a little ridge broken by shadufs and a complaining sakiheh around which a cow toiled. I like them best when a camel is working them. Camels always look so absolutely superior to anything they may be doing. I heard such a nice reason the other day for the superciliousness of the camel. Allah has one hundred names - the Faithful know ninety-nine of them but the camel knows the hundredth!...Then I cut across a cultivated little gully, climbed up the other side and, behold, the three palm trees, looking quite lovely and presiding over the very verdant outskirts of a tiny village. I came back another way and was ready for quarts of tea when I got here.
