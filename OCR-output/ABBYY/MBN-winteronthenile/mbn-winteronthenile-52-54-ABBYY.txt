I think, in a way, that is the most amazing sight I've seen in Egypt. Those enormous subterranean passages, those incredible titanic sarcophagi of granite, the inconceivable labor and ingenuity of it all, in order that the sacred bulls should be fittingly buried! Certainly they were an extraordinary people, those ancients of Egypt. We finished our sightseeing with the tomb of Thir, where I got so tired that I began to think of the back of my camel as a haven of rest. Then we mounted, had our photographs taken, and turned our faces homeward. It took us just two hours to return and when we got to Mena House at six we drank quarts of tea. We asked the waiter when the next train would leave for Cairo and he replied "The next train has gone!" So we telephoned for a motor and got back just in time to dress for our eight o'clock dinner. The wonders of Sakkara are very great, but in my memory the chief glory of today will always be that enchanting ride over the desert under that vast, vast sky of triumphant blue with heaped up masses of snowy cloud, the sweet, wild wind in our faces and the effects of light and of drifting cloud - shadow things of indescribable beauty.
Tuesday. April 1. Cousin Theodore had such a dreadful tooth this morning that I took him to the dentist's and had it out. He suffered so horribly a year ago because he didn't have a tooth out, that we didn't delay it on this occasion for fear he would change his mind. The news of Mr. J. P. Morgan's death came this morning.
Cairo is bursting into bloom as befits the time of year. The flowering trees are something ecstatic. We have one in the gardens of this place that is a dream of beauty. I think it's a kind of magnolia - a very large tree with small blossoms.
This afternoon Cousin Emma and I left cards on Mrs. Peter Augustus Jay, and on Mrs. Grahame, an Englishwoman whose husband is one of the officials here, and then I came back to the hotel for the great pleasure of having Emily and Marian Whitney to tea. It was so nice to see them. We had tea in the great hall which was once the scene of an atrocious crime. This palace was the one Ismail built for the Empress Eugenie to occupy at the opening of the Suez Canal. After that he had it for one of his own royal abodes. He had a foster brother who was supposed to be his closest friend and his dearest one. He took him to drive one day and, on their return, as they entered the great hall, guards seized the foster brother and killed him there while that unspeakable beast, Ismail, strolled up the marble staircase as though nothing were happening. After tea, Mr. Hine, the manager, took us through the Casino. It is so unattractive on the outside that I had never taken the trouble to go in, little imagining the splendors of the interior. But it seems it was a part of the royal harem and many of the old furnishings are still there, and it is really regal.
After we'd seen that I got a carriage and took the Whitneys to the Beduin as they never had seen the inside of a dahabya. They graciously said they found it even more interesting than a royal palace. They wanted me to go back with them to dine at their hotel, but I couldn't.
Wednesday. April 2.
The birds in the gardens about this place are legion. At night you can hear the mewing owls and a lovely call in a chord of two notes that I'm told is made by a charming little plover that flies in pairs after dark. Early in the morning all kinds of birds begin shouting madly, and when we are dressing sometimes a dashing black or gray crow sits on the railing of our balcony cawing forcibly at us and waiting for us to leave the room so that he may fly in and carry off things from the dressing table. And today when Doris and I passed through the salon of this suite, two sparrows were sitting facing each other in two gilt framed, yellow brocaded chairs. They fly in and out as they list. We all five of us motored about in a more or less aimless fashion this morning. And once the Khedive flashed by us like a flame in his car. This afternoon Cousin Theodore, Harry
49
and I motored out to Mena House for tea, and on the way we saw a quite horrid sight. The sidewalk in front of a handsome house was drenched with blood, and a dead buffalo was just being dragged away by the heels. Neither Cousin Theodore nor Harry knew what it meant, but I did, having just read about the custom in a book called "Veiled Women". It's one of their pleasing little marriage ceremonies when a bride enters her new home to cut the throat of a live buffalo in front of her at gateway or door.
This must go in its unfinished condition. These are such crowded days, and such beautiful ones -the air goes to my head like wine.
Much love to you all. My next will probably be posted at Naples.
Your devoted Mary.

Dearest Adeline:- I'm not sure about the number of this letter but it's next to the one I stopped abruptly last week.
Our winter in Egypt is a thing of the past, but with spring in Italy and England before us, and Home after that, we go on our way rejoicing in spite of certain regrets and the fact that camels have dropped out of our lives "it may be for years and it may be forever". Chief among my regrets are the following:
I did not see Lord Kitchener I did not see a polo game I saw no dervishes.
While we were at Luxor there was some sort of a function that brought the dervishes to Cairo, and they lay in the street while their sheik rode over them on horseback. We read about it in the papers. Certainly some of the spectacles in Egypt are lurid ones, and I thank Heaven I belong to the Anglo-Saxon race. Doris and Harry saw a sight the day we went to the Tombs of the Caliphs which haply escaped me as we flashed by in the motor car, and that was children prisoners in chains. I should think Lord Kitchener would "advise" the Khedive to discontinue that practice. However, I suppose it takes time for even a giant like Kitchener to correct all of the worst abuses in a land so packed with them. That expedition to the Tombs of the Caliphs I hug to my memory with special delight because we came near not seeing them and it would have been such a loss. They make, on the outskirts of Cairo and close to the edge of the desert, a little city of their own crowned with beautiful domes and exquisite minarets, and are so wrapped in sunshine and loveliness that there is no thought of gloom. That same day we went to see a mosque whose name no one could remember and the guide books were all packed. But it's the second largest one in the world and is a beauty, with its hundreds of columns built around a large and arid court in the center of which is a well and one tree. The two principal things that are pointed out to you are the granite column and a magic stone. The granite column came to the mosque all by itself from Mecca. And the stone is possessed of healing properties so that when the Faithful have aches in their tummies they go and lick the stone till their tongues bleed. They've licked a deep groove in the stone and the whole thing looks quite horrid. Lord Kitchener must have"advised" the stopping of that rite, because recently an iron grating has been put in front of the stone.

During the last week in Cairo there was a little social flavoring mixed in with shopping, sightseeing and the daily round. I lunched one day with the Contessa and Mr. Tremayne at the Continental, and Mr. Tremayne, putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out a little wad of paper, said "Here, Mrs. Newberry, is an antique I've been carrying about for weeks meaning to give you" and there was a heavenly bit of the perfect Egyptian blue with the sacred eye or Horns on it - the very thing I had hunted for in vain in the shops at Luxor.
I've had it set in a ring and it's fascinating.
Various people came to call, among them Watson Pasha, a Personage indeed in Egypt, being the Khedive's one English aide. I was out the afternoon he came but I met him a day or two after at a tea at the Grahames and found him a most delightful person. Lean and tanned and simple and direct and amusing. So tanned that if it were not for the clear cut, clean English features he might easily have been taken for a native. The King of Siam did take him for one. He had been sent to meet that potentate and escort him through the Suez Canal. Major Watson was wearing the uniform of the Egyptian Army and as His Majesty of Siam shook hands with him he said "I hope it is perhaps that you speak a few words of English". As he told me this story he was taking his amber cigarette holder from a gold case. "That is the most sumptuous thing I ever saw" I said. "Wait!" said he and brought out a gold cigarette case and a gold matchbox. "Backshish" he explained. "They can't give me money so they give me these things and I'd so much rather have a check for a thousand pounds!"
The Grahames' place is one of the sweetest I've ever seen, such lovely gardens, such beautiful trees, - a fresh proof of the truth of what I've always said that the English have a genius for taking England with them wherever they go. We had tea on the verandah, and black and grey crows were waiting close by, until we should turn our backs, to steal the cakes.
Our last evening in Cairo was a dream of beauty with the slenderest thread of a new moon floating above a towering auracaria in the garden. The Ghezireh people must have been glad to have us go - they'd been keeping the hotel open just for us and closed it when we left. Mr. Backler, the manager of Shepheard's and the Ghezireh, sent his own motorcar to help convey us to the station as a parting compliment to Cousin Theodore. Various people were at the station to see us off, including seven of the crew of the Beduin, all there were left in Cairo, the others having scattered. They all shook all our hands three separate times and my friend Mohommed, the second captain, looked perfectly superb. We left Cairo at 9:45 and for three hours and a quarter our train sped through lovely scenes. We sailed at two that afternoon and the infinite boredom of seafaring has soaked to the marrow of my bones. There are a lot of awfully good looking men on board and if I knew some of them it might relieve my ennui - but the voyage is too short for making acquaintances. There are three Les Altesses, one of whom has a face like a Japanese mask and blows his nose so deafeningly and oft that I'm in constant fear that Cousin Theodore will speak to him about it. But the Prince and Princess Radziwill (I can't spell it) look the part quite satisfyingly. It has been a polar sea today instead of a summer one. I do so hope we shall find a little warmth in Italy. We expect to arrive in Naples at noon tomorrow.
Heaven bless you all, my dears.
Devotedly, Mary
P.S. Saturday A.M. Last evening I represented the family at the Ship's Concert while Cousin Theodore, Doris and Hariy were playing cards in the smoking room. At a table near them sat the Japanese Mask and the Radziwills talking to each other in six different languages. The Japanese mask blew his nose and Cousin Theodore bounded in his chair, turned and glared at him and said "Good Heavens!" in a loud voice. Then the Japanese mask began spouting pages of Virgil; that
