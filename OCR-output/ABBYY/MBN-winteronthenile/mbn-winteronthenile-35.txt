Cairo this morning in a special train. The Contessa, who was over here this afternoon, says Mohammed Mohassib almost fainted when she told him this morning that his prey had escaped him and that he might now bring forth his treasures and let other people have a chance at them.
Ex-President Porfirio Diaz, with a boatload of "greasy looking Mexicans" (I'm quoting my daughter) has recently been tied up in front of Luxor. Dahabyas come and go and the Stars and Stripes seem to preponderate at the mast heads.
And now I will end this weak decoction and crave everyone's indulgence.

Sunday. February 16.
West Bank at Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- Today we could once more say joyfully, with the fire-worshippers, "Lo! the Lord Sun!" And if we had been without it for a month we could hardly have welcomed it more gladly. Egypt would be an intolerable land if it were often gloomy weather. I'm sure everyone would go mad and drown himself and herself and themselves in Old Nile. Doris went to church alone this morning and brought back the Contessa to luncheon. She stayed a long time, and after Cousin Theodore and Doris had gone for their ride, she held Cousin Emma and me enthralled, as the three of us sat in the sunshine on deck, with the story of her first husband's experiences and death in Central Africa, whither he went with Stanley. When she had finished I felt literally tired from my emotions. It was like a Henry Seton novel for interest and quite ghastly and heartrending. When I come home I'll tell the story to anyone who wants to hear it, but I do not want to write it. The one time I laughed this afternoon was at a scene on the bank. The black dog and the yellow dog, who have constituted themselves guardians of the Beduin for the sake of the food they get, started to fight and were stopped by the turkey cock who, with all his feathers spread and gobbling furiously, rustled in between them. It was really one of the funniest things I ever saw.
Monday. February 17. Nothing much to record today except a furious wind which at one time this morning seemed as though it would tear us from our moorings and blow us across the river. After luncheon I left the boat for the first time in eight days and crossed over to Luxor in the sailing felucca (and a dashing little sail it has) to see if an electrical treatment would relieve the ache that had possession of me. I think it did somewhat. It felt good at the time anyway. Luxor looked almost new to me - it had been so long since I saw it. The Hardys came to tea; they are very agreeable, but it is much easier to imagine Mr. Hardy leading a diplomatic life than Mrs.
Tuesday. I missed a great treat today because of my rheumatism. Harry Burton invited Mr. and Mrs. Pier and Doris and me over to the valley to luncheon and to see the sarcophagus lid in Siphta which has at last been turned over under the supervision of one of Maspero's experts from the museum. The Piers and Doris went and had a gorgeous time. The lid is something unknown in the history of sarcophagi. There are four figures carved in relief upon it - the King is the central figure and there is a little child at each shoulder. Then on one side of him is Isis, on the other Nephtys, and scattered about somewhere are a crocodile and a snake.
After my luncheon I crossed to Luxor for electricity and on coming back found Doris had just returned and was sitting on deck with Newton Byers, one of Roger's classmates, who has been dragged, an unwilling victim, to Egypt by his family. They are on their way up the river on the
