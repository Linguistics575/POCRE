side of the river in case he may want them. We drove out to Kamak to call on Mme. Legrain, who says her husband is nearly dead showing princes and potentates about the ruins. We also called on Mrs. Edgar but didn't see her. When we got back to Luxor cousin Emma came straight home and I paused to refresh myself with tea and Mrs. Pier and to see the throngs at the Winter Palace. Our haughty seclusion on the west bank is well enough in the long run, but I do like once in a while to be in the thick of things.
Friday. February 7. and an almost disagreeable day because of the wind. We meant to ride out to the diggings, but the air was so thick with sand that Doris and I decided to keep to the waterway -so we sailed up the Nile in the little felucca with four of the crew and enjoyed it immensely.
Farewell, dears all. With love and devotion

Dearest Adeline:- This letter ought really to be skipped and all of you may skip it without hurting my feelings in the very least. Since my last, the Land of Egypt has been the House of Bondage to me - the past week having been an unpleasant medley of broken engagements, frustrated plans, homesickness and sciatica. At least I suppose sciatica is the gentle distemper that makes one's left leg feel as though it had been skinned alive and all the muscles tom out slowly with hot forceps. I've managed not to stay in bed and I've also managed to play dominoes, but I've not been up to anything else, and in my off hours have shut myself up in my room, swathed in knitted things and packed with hot water bags, and saying "Hame, hame, fain wad I be, Hame, hame in my ain countree." To cap the climax we are actually having bad weather. It is now three days since the sunshine has been wholly withdrawn and day before yesterday it actually rained all day; fortunately only a gentle sprinkle - had it been a good New Haven downpour the mud village opposite us would have dissolved before our eyes.
On Monday I was to have gone on a picnic to the Valley of the Queens with the Contessa and Mrs. Pier, but Doris went in my place. On Tuesday I was to have teaed with Mrs. Daniel Eaton, way up the river on the Arabia, but had to send a note saying I was too crippled to come. I hope she will carry out her plan of spending a week on her way down.
The other day Doris rode with Dorothy Richardson over to the abode near Der-el-Bahri which is called indifferently "the American House" or "Mr. Morgan's House", and in which live the men who are managing the Metropolitan excavations, and the wives of said men. When the girls got there at ten o'clock the people were just about to have breakfast! As digging stops at four-thirty they must have a short day at the Metropolitan Concession. Mr. Morgan's eccentric behavior has caused a buzz of comment and conjecture. During the two or three days his dahabya lay here the people at the American House spent their time in moving into tents and back again according to messages from the Great Man as to whether he was or was not going out there to occupy. He finally did not go. He had a party of ten on his boat whom he had invited to go to Khartoum and somehow it leaked out that their lives were a burden to them because their host was so cross and tyrannical. The Khartoum plan was suddenly abandoned and they merely tore up to Aswan and back again, being gone only four days. Then Mr. Morgan engaged suites of rooms at the Winter Palace for his party and before they had time to move into them he whisked them all down to

Cairo this morning in a special train. The Contessa, who was over here this afternoon, says Mohammed Mohassib almost fainted when she told him this morning that his prey had escaped him and that he might now bring forth his treasures and let other people have a chance at them.
Ex-President Porfirio Diaz, with a boatload of "greasy looking Mexicans" (I'm quoting my daughter) has recently been tied up in front of Luxor. Dahabyas come and go and the Stars and Stripes seem to preponderate at the mast heads.
And now I will end this weak decoction and crave everyone's indulgence.
Your devoted Mary
Sunday. February 16.
West Bank at Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- Today we could once more say joyfully, with the fire-worshippers, "Lo! the Lord Sun!" And if we had been without it for a month we could hardly have welcomed it more gladly. Egypt would be an intolerable land if it were often gloomy weather. I'm sure everyone would go mad and drown himself and herself and themselves in Old Nile. Doris went to church alone this morning and brought back the Contessa to luncheon. She stayed a long time, and after Cousin Theodore and Doris had gone for their ride, she held Cousin Emma and me enthralled, as the three of us sat in the sunshine on deck, with the story of her first husband's experiences and death in Central Africa, whither he went with Stanley. When she had finished I felt literally tired from my emotions. It was like a Henry Seton novel for interest and quite ghastly and heartrending. When I come home I'll tell the story to anyone who wants to hear it, but I do not want to write it. The one time I laughed this afternoon was at a scene on the bank. The black dog and the yellow dog, who have constituted themselves guardians of the Beduin for the sake of the food they get, started to fight and were stopped by the turkey cock who, with all his feathers spread and gobbling furiously, rustled in between them. It was really one of the funniest things I ever saw.
Monday. February 17. Nothing much to record today except a furious wind which at one time this morning seemed as though it would tear us from our moorings and blow us across the river. After luncheon I left the boat for the first time in eight days and crossed over to Luxor in the sailing felucca (and a dashing little sail it has) to see if an electrical treatment would relieve the ache that had possession of me. I think it did somewhat. It felt good at the time anyway. Luxor looked almost new to me - it had been so long since I saw it. The Hardys came to tea; they are very agreeable, but it is much easier to imagine Mr. Hardy leading a diplomatic life than Mrs.
Tuesday. I missed a great treat today because of my rheumatism. Harry Burton invited Mr. and Mrs. Pier and Doris and me over to the valley to luncheon and to see the sarcophagus lid in Siphta which has at last been turned over under the supervision of one of Maspero's experts from the museum. The Piers and Doris went and had a gorgeous time. The lid is something unknown in the history of sarcophagi. There are four figures carved in relief upon it - the King is the central figure and there is a little child at each shoulder. Then on one side of him is Isis, on the other Nephtys, and scattered about somewhere are a crocodile and a snake.
After my luncheon I crossed to Luxor for electricity and on coming back found Doris had just returned and was sitting on deck with Newton Byers, one of Roger's classmates, who has been dragged, an unwilling victim, to Egypt by his family. They are on their way up the river on the

Rameses III. Senator Aldrich came to tea and gave us some authentic information as to the cause of Mr. Morgan's erratic behavior. He says Mr. Morgan was far from well and was greatly disappointed in his new dahabya "Kargeh" because she was so slow, and that everything seemed to go wrong, and he got tired of the whole business and dashed back to Cairo.
Wednesday. February 19. Today I had a distinct sensation. I went over this afternoon to the Rameses III to call on Mrs. and Miss Byers, whom I found very pleasant - Miss Byers struck me as being a quite rare and lovely person - and while there I saw no less a person than Rudyard Kipling. It seemed so strange that that little (he's very short) commonplace looking man should be packed with such extraordinary genius. I went on from the Rameses to the Winter Palace to have tea with Mrs. Pier and Madam Legrain, and then home. And tonight Doris dined on the Rameses with the Byers and then drove with them to Kamak to see that wondrous place in the moonlight. She says it surpassed any moonlight vision she ever heard or dreamed of.
Thursday. February 20. The memory of today will always be a mingled one of the Contessa and grateful warmth. The Contessa invited me to spend the day with her, so I went over about noon and we sat and baked in the sheltered sunlight in the Luxor Hotel garden. It must be 15 or 20 degrees warmer on that side of the river than with us, and I've been hankering for the heat of the sun to annihilate my aches. The Luxor Hotel itself is a gloomy place and I can't think why the Contessa chooses to stay there. The garden is the only tolerable part. We had coffee there after luncheon in the dismal dining room, and then we made a tour of the antiquity shops which I found vastly amusing. Everywhere it was woe at Mr. Morgan's departure without even a look at things that had been saved for him for weeks. It was at Hassan's at the end of our rounds, that I saw the only things I really wanted. It's surprising how ephemeral many of one's desires prove themselves if one refrains from plunging into buying the moment one gets to a strange place. Dozens of things I thought fascinating when I first began to look about the shops, I now pass with averted gaze because they tire me so. But Hassan brought out ten little alabaster jars (tunbler shaped) with a cartouche sunk in the side of each and colored blue, and an alabaster cover to each the size and shape of a large cream peppermint, and I coveted them with my whole heart. But the price of even one of the darling things was too much for me. Hassan's shop is quite a mansion with all his treasures on the second floor. You mount a flight of stone stairs which would be imposing if it were not for the traces of many chickens, and while you are poking about among the antiques a tiny page in red and white brings you coffee, of the best, in dainty cups. I brought the Contessa home with me for tea.
Friday. February 21. And a perfectly commonplace day. Calls with Cousin Emma this afternoon and tea at the Winter Palace, which seems to be more or less packed with freaks at present -ladies who wear thin white dresses with no petticoats and pose in the doorway with miles of Egyptian sunlight behind them. On our way back to the Beduin the felucca was caught in the wash from the Aswan boat just coming down the river, and from the deck of it Mr. and Mrs. Dodge and Janet waved.
Washington's Birthday.- and a nice American day as befits an American on February 22 wherever she happens to be. I played dominoes all the morning and in the afternoon I crossed over to Luxor, ordered a carriage, annexed those enchanting Pier children and drove out to the Savoy to call on Mrs. Daniel Eaton. As we passed along the waterfront - "Children" said I, "do you know why all the American boats are dressed in flags today?" "No", said the sweet little voices. "You don't know what day this is?" "No", expectantly and excitedly. "Why, it's Washington's Birthday". "Oh, is it? Why, I don't believe Father and Mother know it." "Then you must tell them when we get back". Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle were out, and we drove back again all too soon. As
