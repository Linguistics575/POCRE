This afternoon Cousin Emma and I, in response to the Contessa's importunities, went over and teaed with her in the Luxor Hotel gardens. She was very hoarse and the ground was very damp, but the sunshine lovely, the tea delicious and there were three other guests, quite charming - Lady Baring, Mrs. Murray and the Countess Pauline Pappenheim. I talked to the latter all the time, and I'm thankful I don't fall in love with men as easily as I do with women. The Countess Pauline is a girl after my own heart - about Doris's age, I should think, and with a very noble sort of beauty, and too sweet. She told me she was half American - that her mother was a Philadelphian, but I don't know who. And all this time I've been skipping yesterday which may be briefly summarized as follows:
The boisterous Mr. Whymper came to breakfast. (I've decided all that excitable volubility is his company manner, because when he crosses over with Doris and me in the felucca on our way to church he is quite pleasantly quiet, and his face in repose is sad.) I went to church and after service had a little talk with Mrs. Daniel Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle for whom I waited outside the door. Brought Mr. and Mrs. Pier home with me for luncheon. They grow more and more delightful. Two English ladies came to tea - Mrs. Morhouse, hushed and gentle and sweet - and Mrs. Aylmer, who might easily be colonel of a regiment. I believe her husband is. Yesterday was the warmest day we've had, I think, and today there has been a touch of Khamseen - the hot, thick wind of Egypt. It made the sunset tonight one of opaque, almost suffocating gold.
Tuesday. February 25. The comings and goings today have been crowded. Doris and I dashed across the river immediately after breakfast to buy Soudanese beads together, and then I dashed back again, leaving her to play with Dorothy Richardson. Just after I returned to the Beduin, Harry arrived for his holiday, courteously wearing the necktie I crocheted for his Christmas present. He presently crossed over to have his hair cut and pick up Doris. I was in the middle of a game of dominoes when I heard a voice on the land side of us demanding "Is anybody at home? Is anybody at home? Is Mrs. Newberry in?" and Mrs. Eaton and Mrs. Van Winkle descended from a sand cart and entered via the gangplank. They'd been to the Ramesseum - or somewhere.
A brief visit and they departed after I'd shown them over the dahabya. Then Harry and Doris came. Luncheon next. After which the two young people went for a sail. About 4 P.M. who should arrive - taking my breath away with the violence of the surprise - but Karl Weston (Professor of Romance Languages at Williams) whom I last saw twelve years ago when we took tea together in a chestnut tree at that queer place "Robinson" outside of Paris. Close on heels came Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson, who had been asked to tea. Cousin Theodore went below and couldn't see anybody. Then at 7:15 Doris, in her war paint, went across the river to dine and dance at the Winter Palace - so it's been almost as hectic as some of the days at home...Doris just back at 11.30 and says she Bostoned most of the evening with Newton Byers - of 1912 Sheff. - and saw the family of that Perfect Beauty, Radcliffe Romeyn, 1912 Captain of the Yale Crew.
Wednesday. February 26. I called this afternoon on the Romeyns on their steamer and was very glad to see them, but was freshly impressed with how awful it would be to go about in a Cook's party - infinitely better though than not to go at all. Mrs. Romeyn said she had almost despaired of seeing us because the only information Radcliffe could give her of our whereabouts when she bade him good-bye, was that we "were travelling with some big bug on a private dahabya that tied up anywhere it pleased along the Nile". They go on to Aswan tomorrow. I teaed at the Winter Palace with Mr. Weston and had a lovely time. That is a most congenial young man, and it seems absurd, when he lives in Williamstown and we in New Haven, that we should meet only once in ten years or so in the top of chestnut trees in Paris, or at Hundred Gated Egyptian Thebes.
