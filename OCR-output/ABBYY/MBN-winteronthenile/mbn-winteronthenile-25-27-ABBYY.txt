The felucca had, according to orders, moved up stream till directly opposite the dahabya, and therefore was lying in front of the tiny native village at which we gaze daily from the Beduin. While sitting there I had ample opportunity to observe native life, some of which - like Sugar's behavior - would sully these fair pages if chronicled thereon. The most pleasing episode was the gambols of the children with two fuzzy black puppies whose sombre fate it is to grow up into abhorrent, snarling, unloving and unloved Egyptian dogs. Three men in black robes and white fringed shawls wound around their heads strode down the bank from the hamlet with a small flock of sheep, which they picked up one by one and deposited in a boat. The animals neither struggled nor uttered a bleat. Presently in a sort of hurly burly of dust, barking dogs and shouting children, Cousin T. and Doris, with their escort of donkey boys and sailors, came down the bank, and we rowed home to the Beduin. We found Mr. and Mrs. Hardy and Dorothy Richardson teaing with Cousin Emma. Dorothy Richardson is the daughter of Dr. Richardson of Athens and an uncommonly attractive young woman. Her uncle, Mr. Hardy, is an ex-diplomat of sorts, whom I suppose I ought to be able to place but can’t.
Wednesday. January 15. I crossed over at ten o'clock to play tennis with Dorothy R. on the Winter Palace court. We had two good sets before the sun grew too fervent, and then I left her to her letters and started home for mine. Wednesday is our best mail day. En route to the felucca I paused at the chemists and whom should I encounter there, buying a toothbrush, but Mrs. Fred Morley, who for two or three years was my next door neighbor (and a very nice one) in Colorado Springs! This afternoon Doris invited Dorothy Richardson to ride to Kamak with her, and they were gone a long time and, Doris said, enjoyed themselves vastly. At tea time we had a visit from Sir Gaston and Lady Maspero who came down the river in the Dahabya Miriam two days ago and are to be here a couple of weeks. On Monday he is going over to the valley to give The Last Word as to the importance of the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah. We are divided between our hopes that it will be so fine that Maspero will want it in the Cairo Museum, and that it will fail by a hair's breadth to meet that requirement so that we can give it to the Metropolitan.
I forgot to record that Doris and I were again invited to dinner and the dance last night at the Winter Palace. I declined, but Doris went and had a lovely time and met a lot of English officers.
Thursday. January 16. Nothing of any particular interest to record today - just a lovely day, beginning pleasantly with waffles and maple syrup, and proceeding with a little too much wind and therefore sand in the atmosphere. We all stayed by the Beduin this morning but in the afternoon Doris and I took the felucca and went over to call on Mrs. Morley. She and her son Fritz are on the Egypt, one of Cook's new Nile steamers, and are here for a couple of days on their way up the river. We took them over to the Winter palace to show them those lovely gardens which have grown truly as if by magic in just four years. Incidentally we saw the little Egyptian gazelle buck looking so dainty and charming it was hard to believe he had recently killed four of his own children. We had tea on the terrace before separating, the Morleys to return to the Egypt and we to the Beduin.
If you could but see the stars from the vantage point of the Nile! Is there any other land I wonder where Sirius glitters with such a blue diamond light?
Friday. January 17. A lovely morning and a disappointing afternoon. Shortly after ten Doris and I crossed over the river and went to see Mr. Whymper's pictures. We attracted the attention of that gentleman by the simple process of whistling outside his window, his room being on the ground floor of the Winter Palace. I did the whistling during and in spite of the protests of my daughter, who seemed to think it a very vulgar proceeding. It has the advantage of giving the
22
victim no chance of escape if he happens to be sitting by the window, as this one was. We had a delightful half or three-quarters of an hour with him while he tore up and down his room and ranted with a pipe in his mouth and a checked cap on his head (except when he periodically remembered and took it off only to clap it on again in a fit of abstraction). He mimicked people looking at pictures, and birds in their native haunts till you could see the latter quite as distinctly as the former. And he showed us some lovely things he had painted. One gem of Medamet is tearing me to pieces. Its price is just the sum of a check Mrs. Thompson gave me for Christmas, but a conflict rages in my "buzzum" because I had determined to buy with it some piece of jewelry, and I can't make up my mind which could give me the greater and more lasting satisfaction. I have a barbaric fondness for jewels.
This afternoon the donkeys were brought over to this side of the river and we three were to have ridden to Medinet Habu. But the wind blew up and Cousin Theodore wouldn't go and made such a row about Doris and me going that we compromised and I stayed at home.
And now A1 Allah for this week, and dear love to you all.

Sunday night. January 19.
West Bank, Luxor
Dearest Adeline:- We have with us again the moon silvering the surface of the Nile, turning the desert sands to snow and driving the dogs of Luxor mad. At least I suppose it is the moon. It certainly is not joie de vivre which makes them bark, for the poor things haven't any. But Kim flying up Orange Street frenziedly barking at the victoria containing Mr. Justice Hotchkiss (a spectacle Kim always finds intolerable) does not make more of a row than each and every canine dwelling across the river on those nights when "the moon doth with delight look round her."
Doris and I went to church this lovely morning and managed to be late, which was wholly unnecessary as we had been sitting on deck waiting for the time to get into the felucca and be rowed over. Mr. Whymper was also late and came racing after us as we neared the church door, and we all hurried in together without his having a chance to criticise our clothes. "What's this for? And what's the meaning of that? Women wear such rummy clothes!" He observes in an amused voice, usually when he meets us.
When we got back to the Beduin at luncheon time we found a very nice batch of letters from home - yours of the 31 st December, Adeline dear, for which so many, many thanks, was one, and another from Susan in Summerville giving unstintingly the hallmark of her approval of Doris and my devotion to that dear place.
About half past four a cavalcade started for the valley. Cousin T., Doris and Jones mounted on their respective donkeys, and my new donkey loaded with luggage and groceries instead of with me. And tomorrow morning that matchless trio of Egyptologists - G. Maspero, T. Davis and D. Newberry - will pass final judgment upon the red granite sarcophagus in the tomb of Siphtah. Cousin Emma and I heroically remained behind to dispense tea and cakes to some people named Sprague from Buffalo, who had brought letters and whom Cousin T. refused to be bothered with. They brought a young niece, Alice Keating, with them, whom I liked. Mr. Sprague reminded me somewhat of "The Man from Home" and he certainly voiced my feelings when he said that in this land he was "completely dazed by the enormous amount of what he didn't know".

My own doings today have been of the humblest compared with the brilliant career of my daughter. I spent the whole morning straightening out Cousin Theodore's bank account, and when I had finished my temperature was 120. After luncheon, to clear my brain and get some much needed exercise, I went forth on a long walk with a sailor at my heels. I saw lovely things -stretches of sloping river bank clothed in bean plants blossoming forth in stylish black and white flowers, great fields of peas with their reddish violet blooms, some brown little boys entirely nude who dived frantically for their shabby garments when they saw me coming. Then home packed with fleas which I had annexed in a native village through which my walk led me.
On the deck of the Beduin in the lovely afternoon light, I found the Contessa Contardone and Mr. Tremaine taking tea with Cousin Emma. Another guest arrived on a donkey, Dr. Alan Gardiner, an Englishman eminent for something but I don't know what. All I know is that he's much too fat. And then our ears were smitten with an appalling though distant bray and we knew our family was approaching. They looked like pictures of explorers returning from the heart of Africa as they came in single file across the sand the baggage donkey at the head. Doris was beaming, Maspero had pronounced the sarcophagus superlatively fine - saying there was only one other like it. He was unwilling to have the lid (lying face downward on the ground beside it) turned over without the utmost care and is sending to Cairo for the proper apparatus. He wants the sarcophagus for the Cairo Museum, but he wants Cousin T. to pay for its transportation thither (he says it will cost 250 pounds sterling to do it) and Cousin T. does not at the moment feel inclined to do it. Maspero and Mr. Edgar, Inspector of Excavations in Upper Egypt, lunched at the House in the Valley with Cousin T., Doris and Harry Burton, and Doris says it was the treat of a lifetime to hear Maspero talk, which he did from one o'clock till three-thirty. He talked about Egypt and excavations, about Louis Quatorze brocades, about Chinese porcelains, about music, about the way the Cretan women dress their hair, about Sevres enamel, about most of the beautiful and interesting things in the world. Isn't it simply splendid that Doris could have had such an experience?
Tuesday. January 21. This has been a day! Some of the narrative of its events may tax your credulity but I shall tell things simply as I saw them. The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic to Medinet Habu, and we agreed to meet her out there at eleven o'clock. We started gaily forth at ten with Nobi, Malimond and one of our sailors as escort. Doris has changed the name of her donkey (which some idiot had christened "Lovely-Sweet") to Hermes, because he goes so fast. My new mount, Wadi Haifa, the nefarious Sugar's successor, is a jewel, and I now see delectable ambles spreading out on an almost endless vista before me. We had gone only a short distance when Doris had a nasty spill. Her donkey stepped in a pitfall (forgetting that he was supposed to have wings to his heels), threw her, fell on her and kicked her - not viciously but in his struggles to get up. She declared she was not hurt and insisted on proceeding to the picnic. (A lame shoulder for two days was the only bad result). Promptness being one of our petty vices, we were of course the first at the rendezvous. The Contessa and the rest of the picnic did not arrive till quarter of twelve. But who would mind waiting indefinitely at Medinet Habu on a glorious day? The Contessa brought with her to entertain her guests the Snake Charmer of Esneh, whom she had summoned down for the purpose. We started out at once skirting the Coptic ruins which lie close to the southwest walls of the temple. Walking with leisurely steps in advance of us went the stately figure of the Arab in his black robe and white turban, with the ordinary long stick of the camel driver in his hand. Behind him stalked the Contessa all in white from her snowy, floating veil to her spotless shoes (which didn't stay spotless), smoking one cigarette after another. The rest of us, ten in number, came on by twos and threes, looking perfectly commonplace in our ordinary donkey clothes. Over the burning sands we went under the burning sun, while the Arab in a loud clear voice recited a sort of incantation. And from the
