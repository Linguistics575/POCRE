Friday. December 13. This is a land of pure delight. I've spent the entire day, practically, on deck, absorbed in watching shores Cousin Theodore pronounces "dull". The first thing we saw after breakfast (we started about an hour before we were up) was that strange monument the Arabs call the "false pyramid" - the Pyramid of Meidum, built in three concentric towers, the central one the highest. To me it's much more impressive than the other pyramids. The scenery today has been less spectacular than yesterday, but everything is so fascinating and there is no stretch so desolate but that you see some human figures, these splendid figures in their always artistic robes - not blue as in Cairo where nine-tenths of the natives wear the most heavenly shades of blue, but in sharp contrast of black and white. Sometimes it will be a solitary figure seated brooding by the Nile, far from any habitation, or a group of women filling their water jars at the river, men working at a shaduf or, most delightful of all to me, a frieze-like effect against the sky (when the road runs along the top of a high embankment) or a camel loaded so with cane that you can only see his legs, a woman with a water jar upon her head, a donkey ambling along with a shrouded Arab sitting on his tail (almost), a camel with a rider swaying on his back, -1 never in a thousand years could get tired of it. The strangest village we have seen today we did not at first recognize as a village - it so melted into the hills behind it, as bare and desolate as they - the whole scene made up of burning sand, glaring rocks and sun-baked mud, except, clear down in the foreground by the river, a tiny square of emerald grass with three lovely trees. Presently we came to the most fascinating sight of the afternoon - on a point at a bend in the river, and surrounded by palms, the cream colored Coptic Convent of Mar Antonios, with a splendid tree top springing up through the roof. Back of the convent starts a caravan route to the Red Sea.
Just before the luminous dusk began to steal about us we slipped past an estate with a villa of importance and many outhouses and all the air of belonging to Someone-in Particular - perhaps to "Our Mother of the Khedive" as the dragoman say. And from beneath the giant palms three camels arose at the bidding of an Arab and slipped down to the river to fill up their fifteen stomachs.
Saturday. December 14. And Doris' birthday. We have passed through scenes today considered uninteresting by those who have been up the river twenty-two and down it twenty two. But Doris and I loved every foot of it. About the middle of the afternoon we tied up to an island in order that the tug might coal at Shekh-Fadl, a town with a huge sugar factory close by on the mainland.
Doris and I immediately took to the island for a walk, with one of the crew as bodyguard. I privately scouted the idea of the necessity when we started out but changed my mind before our return. An Arab of your own carrying a stout stick is a comforting appendage when you meet other Arabs in lonely stretches. Our island had no houses, but it did have numerous vegetable gardens. It was much larger than we thought when we first undertook to walk around it.
Walking in the powdery sand along the shore was tiring, and then I proved that between persons of intelligence community of language is not necessary. "Why", said I to our Arab, who knows not a word of English, "can't we cross over here to the boat?" "Because", said he in Arabic, of which I know only the one word "Kaddah" (liar), "we may not walk through the standing crop."
Sunday. December 15.- and the first warm morning that we've had. We have passed close to the base of giant limestone cliffs where hordes of white-robed men were quarrying and tumbling great pieces of gleaming rock down to the water's edge. The sunshine on the scene made a blinding glare, but it was very beautiful; and then came the splendid Gehelet-Ter ("Bird Mountain") rising sheer from the water, and on its summit the Convent of Der el Adra ("Our Lady Mary the Virgin"). It is also called the Convent of the Pulley, because visitors used to be hauled up by that device. Now there are steps cut in the rock, and as we looked there came bounding down them with incredible speed a woman with a water jar on her head. Today we have seen for the first time those long, long stretches of brilliant green close to the river's edge, which in my childhood I
