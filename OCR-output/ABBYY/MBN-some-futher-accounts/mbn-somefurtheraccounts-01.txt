Dearest:	Your	Uncle	says	you	are	a	splendid	looking	fellow	anc
fine one. "And you are his Mother", he added. "I am his proud and Mother" 1 said. To be justly a proud and happy Mother is to my thi the highest pinnacle of joy that a woman can attain.
Auf Wiedersehen, Beloved Mim
Tuesday Night, Nov. 26, 1912
Darling Gopher -	This voyage is almost over; - We are due in Na
in the morning at the crude hour of six, though we don’t have to ge until considerably later. But, presumably, there will be bumpings bangings and yellings from five on so that sleep will be wooed in v The voyage has been a good one as voyages go. This steamer is very and most remarkably steady; the service is excellent, willing and mi courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if y were so disposed. The menus have included everything the plain Amej has been used to from infancy, as well as everything you never hearc from "Spit-cake" to "Lobskans with dilled cucumber."
After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we reti to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with baskets of fru boxes of flowers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to 'I	whom	we	have endeared ourselves. One wondrous basket was from Neiso
and Wallace, and a box of chrysanthemums as big as cabbages with ste a yard long was from	.	We	were	an hour late i
sailing, and didn't start till twelve.
<	Our	one disappointment was the thick weather which prevented our hr.v
anything more than very unsatisfactory glimpses of the Azores, But OhI ..Gibral tar J The Sister-Kitty says she has written you all about but I doubt if even her fluent pen can give you more than a faint id of the splendour, the grimness and the charm of that wonderful spot. We did so hanker for you, - and Jones was the first to sav it aloud, how much he wished you were ther.-.
Yesterday uur first day in the Mediterranean was perfectly beautiful a smooth pale blue sea, and the splendid almost sinister coast of Af: very near, with mountains so high there was snow upon their summits, was after dark when we anchored before Algiers last evening and Cous: Theodore quite refused to let D. and me go ashore even with the peerless Jones. "They are everyone of them beasts in that town" he said shortly, "There's no knowing what they might say to you". "Not with me there, sir," said Jones. But he wouldn't let us go. However the flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in J moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely packed buildings j ing to the crest of the hill was a lovely spectacle from the deck of ship. Today the Mediterranean has been too choppy for perfect beauty but we've had Sardinia with us most of the time with its rocky’ mount?
ranges, fit home for hordes of bandits. Baedecker say’s briefly’ that "public safety is not guaranteed to travellers in Sardinia."
