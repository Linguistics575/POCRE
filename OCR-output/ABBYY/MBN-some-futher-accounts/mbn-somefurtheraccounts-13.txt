Tuesday night Doris and I made our first plunge into Luxor society. There are some perfectly charming Americans, Mr. and Mrs. Garret Pier, staying at the Winter Palace, find they invited D. & me to dine and stay for the regular Tuesday evening dance. It was such a fascinatin; way to go to dinner, - to step into an immaculate felucca and go skim: down the starlit river with six white durba.113 bowing rhythmically bef< us as the men bent to their oars; then to be escorted by two of our a bearing lanterns, up to the entrance of the hotel, and to find them, standing like statues fiwaiting us when we left the hotel at eleven. Doris met some awfully amusing young Englishmen, two or three of whom could actually dance well, and I enjoyed myself immensely just tnlkin to people.
We’ve just had a Baron find Baroness Von Bissing lunching with us. He is a sort of German translation of Leonard Bacon. The resemblance is too amusing. We see by the Paris Herald that George Bourne has been married. I wonder if he will come out here on his wedding journey.
You will now be able to tell me something of Mrs. Moses. I’ve writte twice without getting an answer to either missive. I cannot underst? it. Please be sure to send me her new' address, though I should thinh Savannah, Georgia would reach her. And have you been to see Kim? Please go I I can’t bear to have him forget his family’’. Dr. Nolte i: the name, and you can find the'.address in the telephone book.
Endless love from us both and please write to your adoring
Mim.

days is pretty' quick work, the quickest possible I fancy. I was ewf glad to get it, and I am also glad to be able to tell you that its quite all	right with Mr. Eells as well as	with	Mrs., for I	had a fir
long letter from him on Sunday expressing	much	disappointment, but r
traces of	annoyance at your failure to come to	Cleveland.	He is so
sensitive	I was afraid he might think you	*/ent	to Savannah	merely be
cause you preferred to. Congratulations on having passed your exam: also on having done the nice thing at Christmas by' Kan, and others i your grandmother. By' the way, did you really' - as ma.n to man, mind, like your waistcofit? Doris and I had an argument over it. She mail you would think it vulgarly loud, while I insisted that there was nc in getting a fancy waistcoat unless it was fancy', and I thought it 1 go very well with the Oxford grey' clothes I made you get. Bud TalL had already', in a letter to hie, broken the horrid news about Lefty' ' Cloister has certainly' got a black eyre this winter, nicht wahr?
