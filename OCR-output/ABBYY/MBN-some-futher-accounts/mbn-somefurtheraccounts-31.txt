Best Beloved -	Something so dreadful has happened - I ca
bear to tell you. Jones, dear Jones killed himself four nights ago The Reef. He had been having trouble with his head »nd he must gav gone crazy for the time. He shot himself in the hall outside of hi and the servants found him in the early morning. I think it would killed ConsLn Theodore too had he known the whole truth. Put they him Jones was very ill and had gone home, and the next day chey tol him there was no hope, — and then that he was dead. I have few fri anywhere that I would mourn for more. You have no idea the things did for	me	last	winter - nobody ever in	my life took	care	of	me	lik
that, -	and always begging to be allowred	to do more.	And	in	all	my
I have known few men as worthy of admiration and affection as Jones
It seems a	long	time since I heard from	you. I hope	nothing	is	the
matter.	I	have	postponed going to Ohio	till October.
Endless love. Mother.
