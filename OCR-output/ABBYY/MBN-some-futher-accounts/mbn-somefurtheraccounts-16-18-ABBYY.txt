On Wednesday Doris and I bad one of the pleasant chocks of our lives when a boat drew up beside the Beduin and deposited Mr. Dodge and Janet. None of our Cleveland letters had mentioned that they were coming abroad so it was an absolute surprise. They had come up the river on the Rnmeses III, and left for Aswan the next day, but they are to be here for a week on their return. I went over to the Rameses to call on Mrs. Dodge. I think she was quite cross because neither Paige nor Howard Eells had written me they were coming.
Tuesday Doris and I had a lovely time. Harry had invited us to come ovefc to the valley so as to show us the tomb of Horemheh and me the sarcophagus in Siphtah, and then to have luncheon with him at the House.
We had breakfast an hour earlier than usual, and then started off on our donkeys with our 'donkey boys and a sailor as escort, and Jones to follow us soon as he had got Cousin Theodore started for the day. We rode along the river’s edge as far as the ferry landing place directly oppositi Luxor, before turning toward the Range. The ferry landing that morning was worth going miles to see. Two steamers had come up the night before and scores upon scores of people and donkeys and sandcarts and carriages had come across to take some of the numerous expeditions on this side.
The gay trappings of the donkeys, the blue and white clothes of the donkey boys with a dash of red on their chests all made fine coloring; seven native policemen in Khaki, with their cames waiting for them in the background, the bustle and confusion and everybody yelling at once - it was all immensely- entertaining to me. It was a perfectly delicious day, like all our days, and I did enjoy the ride. The light and color on the Libyan Range as v;e neared it were more marvellous than anything I’ve ever seen, -surpassingly beautiful, but so blinding we had to pull down our chifon veils. The tombs were intensely’’ interesting, especially the paintings on the walls of Horemheh. The unfinished part interested me even more than the beauty of the completed work;- it was just as thoug the artist - dead thousands of years ago - had laid down his pencil and brushes to go home to luncheon.	Our	luncheon at the House with Harry
and Mr. Crane was a very ^.olly affair, and at three we started for home, getting back at teatime and finding the dahnbya seething with people.
One other day this week I was invited by the Contessa Contardone to go to Karnak with a small party, of whom the Russian Princess Gortschokoff was one. Karnak is always one of the most wonderful places in the world, but that afternoon it was secondary in my eyes to the Princess with whom I fell madly in love. Think of a Princess - a real one - like those in novels and storybooks; young, lithe, beautiful, fascinating, quiet and absolutely simple in her manner. I couldn't keep my eyes off her.
We watched the workman excavatin a large and beautiful jar and hoped it would be packed with jewels, but w’hen it was emptied nothing but a brick materialized. We paid a visit to the uncanny goddess Sekmet, she with the lion's head. It is a life-sized statue of black granite which stands in a dusky room in the temple of Ptah, lighted only by a small square window high up in the roof. When you've looked at the creature for five minutes she seems so alive that you sympathize with the Arabs who believe that she sometimes prowls forth and eats people.
Endless love, dearest, from Your Mim.
I long to see you. I don't know how I can wait till June. Are you coming to any definite decision as to whether you will go to Utah or not next summer? I had a letter from Mr. Walcott that shocked me greatly.
He said that when Charlie was brought home in December they did not j| expect him to live more than six weeks; but that now there seemed a good chance of his recovery.
My love to Jack and Wilson	#

Luxor - 1*+ February, 1913
Darling Gopher -	You	are	my best and only Valentine, and I wish
you were here or I were there to tell you so, viva voce. I have notl interesting to record this time of my personal doings because my who] week has been given up to homesickness and rheumatism. I have suffej torments with sciatic.* or neuritis or some kindred diabolical disease in my left leg} and I've not been off the boat since going to church last Sunday morning. To make matters worse the sun - the brilliant, constant, revivifying Egyptian sun - has withdrawn its light for two whole days, and it actually rained all day yesterday, resulting in t] damp and cold and gloom on which rheumatism thrives. But I’m glad il not Doris who is stricken down be her old enemy, If she had to bear in addition to her daily task of Bridge I think she’d go crazy.
Day before yesterday when she came back from a morning across the rii at Luxor she announced that Ex-President Diaz with a party of "greasy looking Mexicans" was tied up over there in a gorgeous dnhabya. He must be glad he is here instead of in his war-tossed native land.
Mr. J. P. Morgan is also tied up over there on his boat, and rumor h; it that the Great Man is as cross as two sticks (he may be having a left leg, also) and making the lives of his guests a burden to them.
We expect to leave here March 1st for Aswan, and I presume we shall find ourselves in Cairo again about March 15th. Mr. Rudy’ard Kipling there now. I hope ray next communication to you will contain more th:
The love I send you is endless
Your Mim.

Best Beloved -	Your letter of Jan. 29 came on Wednesday Jus'
three weeks after you wrote it. I certainly am very far away’-, and I sometimes get frightfully’ homesick for you. I am still more or less; crippled from rheumatism, and it will be two weeks tomorrow since I 1 pleasure of riding my’ donkey'. It makes me chafe to think of how mucl I might have seen in that time, and now our day's here are numbered, as we start for Aswan a week from tomorrow. I do hope the Romeyns will get here before then, - or we may' see them farther up the river;, Last Monday' I left the boat for the first time in eight day's and the) only' to go across the river to see if electricity would do my aching* leg any' good. Tuesday I went again for the same purpose and on ray' rf found Newton By'ers sitting on deck talking to the Sister-Kitty’! I w| much more glad to see him than I’ve ever been before, and Wednesday f afternoon I went over to the steamer Raineses III and called on his I mother and sister. His mother is just a nice, plain mother, but hi4 sister struck me as something quite lovely and fine and rare, which I opinion is cordially’ seconded by' the carping and critical D, Newberif
Just as I was leaving the boat, nfter calling, I had the thrill of seeing no less a person than Rudyard Kipling, who was a fellow passenger of the Dyers family. Doris dined with the Byers that evening and went out to ICarnak with them to see those matchless ruins by moonlight. The Byers said D. was a perfect godsend, because until that evening their son and brother had not laughed since he left America. He told me he didn't want to come at all - that his family had dragged him.
Yesterday I went over to lunch at the Luxor Hotel with the Contessa di 3 Contardone di Villa Marina. You don't have to call her all tha t - just * Countess or Contessa. She is an Englishwoman who made the mistake of c her life in marrying an Italian, now haply dead, leaving her a widow for the second time. Her first husband was an Irishman naiaed Jameson, who died while on an expedition into Central Africa with Stanley; and to hear her tell the story was a rare experience. She is a sister of Sir Mortimer Durand who was ambassador from England to Washington some time ago. She seems to like Doris and me as much as we do her, - though Heaven knows she can't find us a hundredth part as interesting as we do her

This is an extract from your grandmother's last letter. If you stopped to think for one minute how such breaches of ordinary good manners mortify me (actually to the point of suffering) I'm sure you would not again neglect to acknowledge a present or answer an invitation. Please write now to both Mother and Mabel. The latter's address is
Mrs. H. V. Buttolph Uok E. 12th St.

you cun.	Goodbye,	Dearest	Love. I enclose a picture of the Beduin

Luxor - 27 leb. 1913
Best Beloved -	Your letter of the 9th has just come and it made
me weep - I feel so awfully" about Crosson Hayes. V.’hat a perfectly" dreadful thing to have happen. The thought of what he must have suffered made me feel so sick I didn't want any" luncheon, and I'm so low in my" mind I'm afraid this wont be a cheerful letter.
And now I want to explain why I've written so much more elaborate letters to Adeline than to you. I knew she was going to miss me more even than you, because she lives such a shut-in life with so few distractions and almost no occupations; and so I have written those letters to her as full and as well as myr very limited leisure permitted. Then, too, I truly" would not quite have dared to write such long screeds to you for fear you wouldn't read them. Very" few young men have the patience to read long letters. Edward Firth told me that he sometimes carried a letter from his mother for a week in his pocket without-reading it. Of course I know you wouldn't do that, for our relations with each other are quite
