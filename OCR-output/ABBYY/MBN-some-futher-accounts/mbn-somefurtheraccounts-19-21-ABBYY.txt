different from those of Edward and his mother. I'm very flattered that you "had a wonderful time" reading all that manuscript in a bunch. I'm so very sorry you missed that lecture by Mr. Mercer, and ] would love to have had you meet him. I never knew him myself, but Edv and Grace knew him, and were there part of the time with him, if I'm not mistaken. I wish I knew whether the mines are paying and whether its Mrs. Twombly who is doing the mining now that her husband is dead. The Milligan Mining Co. of which your uncle is President is the "Keweenaw Land Association, and I only wish I had some stock in it.
I'm still somewhat lame from my rheumatism, so that I've been on my donkey only once in almost three weeks. That was last Monday and it started up the pain in my leg again so that I've had to forego riding since. It makes me wild to miss so much time and lose so many opporti nities, but I *m glad it's I and not Doris - for the years have, as the ought, brought something of the philosophic mind to me, and I don't mi it as much as she would. She; and Cousin T. rode over to the diggings this afternoon and brought back interesting news. Harry has been excavating a palace of Rarneses III and has found some very extraordinary windows (it was not supposed they had windows in that period) and alsc a couple of bathrooms. I went for a long walk with a sailor to take care of me, - a little too long, for the home stretch through heavy sand was about all I could manage.
Just before we arrived in Africa I said one day to Doris that I imegir we'd meet so many people we knew that the Kile would be like Chapel Si She promptly bet me $5 that we wouldn't meet more than three sets of people that we knew. She has lost, of course, more than twice over. They’ve been quite thick recently. Saturday a.m. Doris and Janet Dodg cavorted about Karnak together, and in the afternoon I had the Dodge family to tea at the Winter Palace. Sunday after church I had a litt] chat with Mrs. Daniel Eaton of Sachem Street, Tuesday a.m. Mrs. Eatoi came to call; Tuesday afternoon thet nice Mr. Weston (you remember hir first in Newport and then in Paris) turned up; find that night fit the c at the Winter Palace Doris bostoned most of the evening with Newton 3} and saw the Romeyns. Wednesday' I went over to coll on the Romeyns, ai Mrs. R. must have been really glad to see me because she kissed me. 1 left for Aswan the next morning, but we shall see them again in Cairo if not before. I took tea with Mr. Weston Wednesday at the W. Palace, ne asked a great deal about you and wanted me to be sure to give you his warm regards. He has been a, full-fledged Prof, at Williams for tl years now,
I had already written to Manson & Co. before your letter came asking them to send you a check for $125. If that isn’t enough to cover you'i Christmfis expenses write me what I still owe you.
We are off on Saturday for Aswan. Up to March 20 send letters as heretofore - Shepheard’s, Cairo. After that care Theo. M. Davis, Esq-; Messrs. Morgan, Harjes & Co. Paris, France.
Please give Crosson Hay's my' love and tell him it is splended to hear I of courage like his. I think he is probably made of the same sort of stuff as that superb Captain Oates in the South Pole party', who after suffering for weeks without a murmur walked out into the blizzard and
lost himself so as not to be n drag upon the rest.	I feel almost
as sorry for the unhappy fellow whose skate struck Crosson as I do for him. It would be so hideous to carry through life the memory of hnvir done a thing like that even if it was utterly unavoidable. I hope you won't forget to tell me in your next how he is coming on.
I shall have to give your love to Wadi Haifa, Sugar's successor. I've never set eyes on Sugar since the day long ago when I got off him bouncing and braying on an embankment and vowed I’d not ride him again.
Good night, my Darling. I do get so terribly homesick for you sometimes that I'd give all the pomp and circumstance of Egypt to be back at 615 Orange St.
God bless you and keep you.safe.
Your loving
Him.
Aswan, 5 Mar chi, 1913
Oh Gopher, I don't know what I would not have given to have h-*>d you here today to go with us on our expedition to the Great Dam. It surely must be one of the Wonders of the World - and what a feat of engineering!
We left Luxor Saturday the 1st and got here yesterday the 4th - 133 miles Baedeker says. Awfully slow going, - but then we stopped tw’ice, the first time at Edfu that Doris and I might see the temple there; and the second time at Kom Ombo ;■ for us to inspect that temple, and also because the wind was bloving so terrifically that navigation was excessively unpleasant, -so we tied up there fit about one on Monday and didn't start again until early the next (ye s terday) morning. Although we were within two minutes walk of.the temple D. and I did not stir off the boat until five o'clock when the wind died down. That Kom Cm-bo temple is an extraordinary one because it is duplex - one side being dedicated to a good god - the elder Horus, and the other to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk. I prefer the later name because it sounds like a crocodile, if said down in your throat with full value given to all the consonants. There is one room in a little chapel on Sobk's side which is full ofmummied crocodiles - quite the ho-rridest things I've seen in a long while. The temple is in a most ruinous condition, but, perhaps, all the more beautiful for that, and the situation and views fire superb. D. and I climbed up on the wreck 6f a splendid pylon and sat there watching the sunset and indulging in a pleasant melancholy, and had it all to ourselves,,except for the faithful escort, Haneen and a sailor, who dogged our feetsteps. It really is awfully good of the Cousins to bring us up here - for they are tired to death of it, having seen it so many times, and they don't go anywhere or do anything except stayr on the boat and arrange for us to see the sights. Yesterday morning shortly after we left Kom Ombo we found a mile of flamingoes standing in ranks and files on the sandbars!
Iv e arrived here about 12:30 yesterday and it was a joyful crew that tied us up, for most of them live here. Doris and I did the bazaar yesterday afternoon with Haneen to drive bargains for us and Amelie and a. sailor in our train. You understand that "the bazaar" in these towns means a long narrow street, or streets, with the roofs nearly meeting overhead and tiny shallow little shops like pigeonholes all along on both sides.
Ke thought the bazaar in Cairo enthralling, but it falls short of this one though it's much larger. This one so reeks of the desert and the strange things that come out of it. You would have gone wild over the

leopard skins and the Soudanese weapons, and the scores of things you* never seen anywhere else.
This morning, immediately after breakfast, D. and I, with Haneen, started for the dam - or the barrage as it's usually called here.
Jones hod engaged a carriage for us at the Cataract Hotel (opposite | which we are lying with only a narrow channel between us), and had a luncheon put up for us in the native basket that looks just like the S square wicker cages birds are kept in at the bird fanciers. In less than five minutes from the time we left that very fine hotel courtyard we were in the desert - and a terrible desert, quite unlike the beaut: ful one at Luxor. Ruined habitations and ruined cemeteries lay along much of the three miles we drove, and it wouldn't have surprised me ii the least, though I would have been white with fear, to have seen lie; stalking about in those desperate solitudes. And then suddenly we were in the midst of an enchanting little cantonment of pretty bunga-: lows, beautiful trees and gardens and verdant terraces, - the settle-1 rnent in which live the officials and chief employees who manage the j barrage. Kv wildest imaginings fell far short of the stunning and bewildering reality. Doris and I elected to walk across the barrage [■ though most people ride on little individual skeleton cars, each one pushed by a native along a track (there are two tracks). It is a milt a quarter long, and there are 180 sluice gates. On the upper side tht Nile lies like a calm lake within ten feet of the top- of the masonry;-: while on the lower side, at least a hundred feet below and about in the middle of the dam this morning where several adjoining sluices we; open there was a thunder and turmoil of waters and foam almost like Niagara Falls. At the far end of the barrage we took a felucca and sailed over to Philai, once the Island called "the Pearl of Egypt," bi now so drowned by the banking up of the waters, that only the very to] of the palm trees show- above the water which laps the capitals of the pillars of the temple. When we got back to the barrage we walked dowi four or five flights of steps along the locks and found another feluc< awaiting us, which Jones had sent up, and in that we came down the rii We had hoped to sail, but there was such a contrary wind the men rowec the way.
There are a few mere sights to be seen tomorrow, and on Friday we sta; on our return trip. The air is splended here,, but the wind blows too much for my complete happiness.
Goodbye, darling. God bless you and keep you safe. I do so hope you will go to church on Easter.
Your Loving Mother.

Thursday, March 13, 1913 Speeding down the Nile
Best Beloved -	At last we are on our homeward say. Of course^
it is going to take us two months and a half to get there, but four months have gone. he left Aswan early Friday morning and reached Luxj, too late Sunday A.M. for D. and me to go to church. We had expected I. to come down flying, having the current in our favor, as well as ttf tug, but mad winds and many sandbars interrupted our progress. Not I; that D and I minded - it was interesting to watch the crew getting us! off sandbars. We -pent the rest of Sunday, and all of Monday and Tues: day at Luxor, tied up as nearly as possible in our old place, and wit nothing very exciting doing. Doris paid one final visit to Karnak
