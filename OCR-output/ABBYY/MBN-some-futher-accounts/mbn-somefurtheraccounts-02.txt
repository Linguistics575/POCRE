postal from Endless,
Darling Gopher -	The day we got to Naples was simply heavenly.
I posted you a letter from there the minute I reached the Hotel. Also I posted 23 other letters and notes that I’d written on the steamer.
As we were driving from the steamer to our hostelry, the Grand Hotel, Doris and I grinning with delight over everything we saw, our carriage was held up by what at first seemed to be two leaping, shouting brigands who turned out to be Harry Burton and Jim Whittaker.

In the afternoon while naps were being taken by the Elders, Jim and Doris and I went to the Aquarium, stopping on our way by the seawall to see a lot of fishermen drawing in a seine. They’ did it with a rythmic stamping of the feet and wild shouts and as much enthusiasm as though they’ did not do it twice every’ day’ of their lives.
The Aquarium is wonderful - such extraordinary’ denizens of the deep, and all from the Mediterranean. Later in the afternoon we all went to Bertolini’s for tea. First you drive zigzagging up and up a mountainous road. Then you leave your carriage and walk by means of a tunnel into the heart of the mountain. There you take a lift and go up for
what seems a mile, whereupon you step out on a verandah that seems like XK a terrace in the skies, with the city far below, - the bay, with
