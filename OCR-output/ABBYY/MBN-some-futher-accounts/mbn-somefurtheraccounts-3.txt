Vesuvius to the left and Capri, the Benutiful, in the near distance guarding the entrance to the harbor; and, to the right a dull red classic sunset burning behind a sloping row of cypresses and pines. j was so beautiful it was hurd to believe it true. The next day was hoj-weather and the only thing of interest that we did was the museum, to which Jim and Doris and I went in the morning. But there is never-failing amusement from the windows of the Grand, which is close to the water, with a constant drilling of soldiers in the street by day, and minstrelsy by night.

We boarded this steamer at about 10:30 Friday A.M. in the midst of the; wildest confusion (I fancy it’s always that way in this voluble and excitable land). Jim came down to say goodbye and then betook himself; to his train. We were to have sailed at 12 but were two hours late because of a {gruesome accident. They were lowering a huge bale of sacks of potatoes into the hold when it escaped a guiding hand and smashed a poor man to death against the side of the steamer.

We were, unfortunately, asleep when we passed through the Straits of Mess Today vTe have had a dim, dim glimpse of Crete, and it's getting delici ously warm.

I think you ought to give something to some poor person for Christmas; - a turkey sent to Mrs. Tornberg, 90 Wrolcott St.j would be a charity indeed and could be ordered before you leave for Cleveland.
I thought of you at Pomfret Thanksgiving Day. It was hard to realizej in Naples, (with nothing at all to mark the day except the many, mnny things we have to be thankful for), that in our native land, Turkey and Cranberry were reigning supreme.
