hen the felucca took Doris nnd me	across	the river, end	Harry' Burton
et us nt the steps (he is stopping	at the	Winter	Palace,	there being no
oom for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church which s away at the rear of a garden filled with palms and acacias and other ovely things, and where an Arab was ringing the bell outside, as they did n "Bunty". And Emily joined us inside. It was very comforting to me o have her to go to church with us this far land on this Day of Days, hen we came back to the Beduin we brought Harry and Mr. Crane (a young nglish artist, son of the better known Walter Crane) to luncheon, fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymkana in the Winter Palace ;ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for tea so we couldn't. The ucks came and Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were :razy about the boat, and we had a	lovely	time.	They go	on their way	to
airo tomorrow at one.	We had	such a	perfectly enormous
inner tonight with only' the four of us to eat it that by the time the :urkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, and have it carried iff unscathed, for we had to eat plum pudding. Jones having heard me emark that I was going to break over my total abstinence on Christmas in irder to drink a toast to you, had supplied chnmpagr,a from the wine :ellar, wherever that may be. The Cousins never touch champagne, so Joris and I drank alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank a :oraprehensive toast to "all the people I love".
Te had a splendid mail awaiting us when we got back from church this norning. It was so good to have it come on Christmas Day. I do hope rou got my first letter very soon after you sent yours. I think I explained in it that people told us on no account to post letters at Gib. jecause it sometimes took months for them to reach their destinations froi there. So I only mailed you a postcard from there & sent my first letter 'rom Naples the minute we landed on the 27th.
Dec. 26th. Doris and I mounted on our gallant donkey's, (mine is named Sugar) and followed by our donkey' boy's (mine is named Mahmoud) rode off this morning towards the Liby'an mountains, the object of our visit being the Colossi - see picture enclosed, which stand not far from their foot. The figures are 52feet in height; the slab pedestals on which their thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, making the entire height 65 ft. Sven in this land of mighty' marvels they seem all that there is of the a ‘ traordinary'.	Well, dearest, dozens of other letters must be
written, so fere thee well for now.
Endless love and many' blessings on your belove head.
Your very7 own Mim

Happy New Year, Best Beloved.	I	got	up	early' so as to make my
greeting to you the first one I either uttered or wrote. And X wrote it just in time, for in another two minutes Amelie came in with my' orange juice,- which is my' waking ceremony every' morning.

The principal thing that has occurred since myr last week's letter to you was our visit to the Valley. \v'e all went out last Friday', Doris,
Cousin T. and Jones riding, and Cousin E and I driving. It's seven miles. I meant to ride also, but I found Cousin Emma hated to drive

alone so I went with her.	Our vehicle	was a	sort of surrey thing	dravif
by two mules and driven by	a pirate in	baggy	white "trou." When we
finally entered the	Valley ray breath was taken away. It	was like driy
ing on a very	good,	glaring white road through the	wreck	of the world,?
Absolutely the desert, not a suggestion of a growing thing anywhere. Towering cliffs all about us, wild masses of rock hurled everywhere, i less stretches of broken fragments of flint and limestone and fossiliz shells, the blazing sun, the splendid cloudless sky. The house is in what is called the West Valley, which, though it contains two or three ; tombs, is not the valley of the Tombs,	being	divided from that by	a
ridge. The house is long,	low (one storied)	flat-roofed, made of	roug
stone, plastered with mud, and looking like thousands of Mexican house It stands in a narrow part of the valley with cliffs directly behind i and a stone’s	throw	across the road in front of it	another ridge divid
ing it from a	third	valley. The bedrooms are like	cells	with little s
of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick walls. The sitting room is bn and mannish and the dining room ditto, - but all very neat. Harry Bur is a delightfully orderly person. You know he is managing your uncle*; excavations and so lives out there in the house. All the water used t is brought miles in jars on donkeyback - as it was in Ecuador. Threr j an excellent cook, and a houseboy and two guards. A guard armed with' rifle stands at the front corner of the house all night.
Saturday morning we fill proceeded to the Valley of the Tombs, Cousin T mounted on Julius Caesar (a perfect devil of a black donkey who loves j his own voice so he brays all the time), Cousin Emma in a chair carrid by two men and D. & I on foot. It was a sensation of a lifetime to ] visit that place for the first time. A number of tombs are open to tlj public, so George Bourne will have no difficulty in gratifying his del But Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the valley,' it was amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gaping tourists end disapp into an opening labelled "Mo Admittance" from which were issuing cloucj of dust and a procession of children carrying dirt and rocks in basket which they emptied on a dump. Most of the manual labor in excavation: in this region is done by children and I hate it. They are urged on I overseers with whips. But our overseer was deprived of his whip last year when Harry saw him cut a piece out of a boy’s leg with the lash.
Time fails to tell you of the marvels of the tombs we saw.That afternoon I took a walk alone and climbed a ridge and went down into anothi valley and up on the ridge beyond. And the sun went down, and withou1 sunshine it is the most terrible place I ever saw. The silence was di ful, and I was suddenly siezed w’ith a horror of the desert and fled b: to the house where I was much rebuked for wandering off by myself. Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our tooties explori the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why all the kings didn'' make their tombs there I cannot understand. It is the most regal, stunning and awe inspiring place I think I ever saw.
Cousin Emma and I came home to the Daha bya Monday morning and gl^d enough we were to get here. But Cousin Theodore and Doris -tarried ti yesterday. He perfectly (excuse me!) adores it. But it would get on nerves terribly unless I had all my occupations and were really- livinl there.

Goodnight, Darling, and God bless my boy.
Your Loving Mim
West Bank at Luxor - 10 JanuDrjr 1913
Darling Gopher -	It's more than two weeks since I've heard from
you and I'm beginning to be afraid that a letter must have been lost.
As for me I've written you with the utmost regularity, beginning with a postal from Gib, followed by a letter mailed the minute I arrived in Naples on the 27th, pursued by another mailed at Alexandria Dec. 2, since which I’ve written once a week. A letter just arrived from Jack Stewrart and written on Christmas day says "I suppose Roger has written you of his visit to Savannah with Bill Hunter". Of course I am wholly mystified. Unless a letter comes from you soon, my feeling of remoteness will begin to be intolerable.
Things go on happening here with the most delightful frequency and the day7s flit by on the wings of the wind. I bask in constant sunlight, and wear summer clothes, and am beginning to look so young that Cousin Theodore persistently refers to me, when speaking to Doris, as "Your sister". Our most recent excitement is a note arrived from Harry7 Burton this morning before breakfast saying that he had found (in a new sepulchral chamber he opened a few days ago) a red granite sarcophagus with a recumbent figure carved on the lid. The note further said it would take about two days to clear away the debris in which it is embedded, Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones are going to ride over to the valley tomorrow afternoon and spend the night, and await developments.
I want to go also, but it isn't fair to leave Cousin Emma alone so I'm going to stay7 with her. I think I shall ride part way' with them for the sake of the ride, and then come back alone with Mahmoud, myr donkey7 boy7 - and possibly one of the crew. When Cousin T. , D. & I go out we a r> quite a cavalcade - we three mounted, and three donkey boyrs and two sailors running beside us. I've come to the reluctant conclusion that my7 donkey7, Sugar, has too small a tummy to cinch a sidesaddle to. My saddle is continually turning and I have to dismount and hold up the procession and have it readjusted. Jones thought it might be the fault of the saddle, and, in his determination to have me suited, the other day7 he, assited by7 two donkey boys and six of the crew, saddled and unsaddled that one small donkey with various sidesaddles while all Luxor looked on. But no sidesaddle stay7s put for more than fifteen minutes on Sugar, so I think I'll have to give him up. I hate to,- he's so pretty and cunning and makes me think of Kim.
Sunday afternoon we took a rather unusual ride, not visiting any ruins (which is what we almost always do) but riding through miles of cultivated fields where steam ployghs were at work ?vnd the water flowing through cemented irrigating ditches,- all more modern and progressive than anything we have seen, and quite dull and uninteresting compared with the native methods.
