Mr. R. observed that Radcliffe was not fond of Europe! "But he is fond of his family" I said. "Oh! he likes his mother" said Mr.
R. - "but not me!" I never have been able to make Mr. R. out!
We saw Helen Walcott again, - she came to see us; and I had from Mr. Walcott one of the most desperately pathetic letters I ever read.
The sense of Charlie's loss grows continually greater with me, and the rose color has faded out of everything. One of the very first things I meant to do on getting home was to go to see him, and it makes my heart heavy to think that the utmost I can ever do now is to go and put some flowers on his grave.
As in Italy so also here - we motor and motor and motor. It's fortunate that both D. and I are so fond of it. Here we have one of the finest cars I've ever ridden in; - but it's always a limosine which destroys some of the pleasure. Today we've been to St. Albans - a magnificent cathedral, the largest, I'm told, in England, and built on the site where the first martyrdom to Christianity took place in England. As Cousin T. was waiting for us outside we didn't half see it, but the drive there and back was lovely.
I got your letter, telling of your visit to Kim and that you thought of going to Sonopah with Fred Brown, jufet before leaving Florence. Would that I, too, might go to Sonopah.
The-Bakers seem to have been very kind about inviting you to meals.
I hope you have called spontaneously at least once. If not please do it before we get home. I don't want my rapture at being with you once again marred by finding you've been rude to people who have been kind to you. Also it will be more in keeping with your self respect to go by yourself than to be dragged there by the seat of your trou by an irate Mim. Oh Dearest how good it will be to see you again!
God keep you safe.
Your loving Mim.

Best Beloved -	Since my last letter I've been so unhappy I
just couldn't bring myself to write. It is nothing that has happen«G to anyr of this party", and it's nothing that I feel like writing about; though I'll tell you the whole story when I get home. 0 blessed word -Home! But the thing has been so constantly" in my" mind that I've not been able to enjoy" anything.
I dined with Mrs. Bonbright the other evening at Claridges. She and Mr. B. live over here most of the time now, and have a place in the country". They were staying in town for a few days preparatory" to sailing for America (which they" did on Saturday") for Howard's wedding! He is marryring a Detroit girl named Elizabeth Hodges, and if she is as lovely" as her picture she must be a Queen indeed. V.re are invited to tea on Wednesday to meet Norman Sturgis and his wife! - or rather
:
they are asked to meet us. The Luckrafts are in town and being awfully nice to us, and so is Lily Solly. Mrs. Bell is still in America. We've done a lot of motoring through this lovely English country. It's a heavenly time of year to be here, but the weather has been horrid. We motored to Oxford yesterday and on our way bad stopped at Stoke Poges, where Wm. Penn was born, and saw the exquis: and very cheerful churchyard where Grey wrote his Elegy. We also came through Eton and saw scores of Eton boys in their silk hats. Their ends didn't correspond - for almost all of them wore slovenly unpolished shoes.
D. and I have been to three picture galleries and have seen such hauntingly lovely things that if it weren't for my darling son and i hankering to see him, I'd like to stay here another month just to look at pictures. I must have told you - though I can't remember -that D and I are going to the York-hnll, as I suppose the MacSherry are still at 615, and I hope they'll stay there all summer.
1*11 probably write you one more little note before we sail. Don't forget date and steamer - May 21, Kronprinz Wilhelm. We ought to 1 on the 28th. Of course I don't know whether or not you were pl^-nni to meet us, or would be able to. But I'm going to say "Don't”. Every extra person only ..adds to poor Cousin T' s confusion of mind, we'll take the first train we can for New Haven. I’ll telegraph y0 the minute we land.
I've had so much to trouble me recently, and I feel so piffliss, I don't want any flaw in my homecoming. So if you love your Kim you' be sure to have done the things I've made a point of your doing (cd ing on the Bakers, and writing those letters) b-.fcre I get there.
Goodnight anu a million blessings on your dear head. My love to JdZck and to 'Wilson.
Your loving Mother.

On the train from Newport
to New Haven.
Best Beloved -
I’m on my way home again,and this, I think, ends Newy for me till autumn. I think I never felt much loreLier in rny life than Saturday night with the feeling that every minute was taking y farther away from me. And I know you felt with me the added woe
-£h§ 19§S of the game. Tate certainly- rubbed it into us this tir It was hard to leave Cousin Theodore - he so hated to see me go. I
( :
offered me the gardener's cottage for the summer.' Even the presence of Cecile who arrived lust evening- with Terry, did not seem to console him for rny departure. H looked so shocking this morning it sent my heart into my mouth.
I'm afraid it's going to be horribl)r hot in New Haven, but with escape before me I suppose I can stand it. I'm longing for your first letter. Please give my regards to Mrs. Morris and tell her how much I appreciate her hospitality to you.
God bless ray boy.
Your loving Mira.

3est Beloved -	It was a joyful surprise to get your letter
from Kansas City, and I hope mine to you from Newport reached you before you left Denver for Leadville.	I got back from Newport
last Tuesday and on Friday went up to The Hill (Cobalt, Conn.) to spend the night with the Tayrlors. I had positively promised them a visit so I had to go. Henry Devereux was there and we had a nice old fashioned Colorado time, and the next; day' they motored me all the way down here, and I gave them inocuous drinks at the Lawn Club before they returned to The Hill.
Doris and Julia got off at noon yesterday, and D. said she would wire me when they arrived at Castine this morning, but no telegram has come, and I'm so anxious I've telegraphed Mrs. Balter to ask if they got there. Nan Hart has sent me an enlargement of that lovely picture of D. on horseback with the mountains behind her. It's a perfect beauty and I'm so pleased. I went out to see Kim this afternoon and he, too, was a vision of beauty in my eyes. He had just been bathed and he was a reddish fluff. He almost ate me up, talking hysterically until he was exhausted and flopped flat on his little tummy' on the floor, thumping his tail and rolling the whites of his eyes at me.
If we find the boarding home at Castine will let us have him we ;i.rp going to have him sent up.	,
I hope to get off on Wednesdayr stopping two days at Springfield (or rather Blandford near there) with Paige. My accommodations on the boat from Boston are engaged for the night of the 4th. Castin, Maine will be our simple address. When you write tell me every detail -. nothing will be too small to interest me. I do hope yrou’ll like it.
Uncle I rank and Aunt Lids want you to stop and make them a visit in Denver on your way home in case theyr are back there from the East.
I paid the bill at once. God bless myr boy and keep him safe.
Your loving Him
