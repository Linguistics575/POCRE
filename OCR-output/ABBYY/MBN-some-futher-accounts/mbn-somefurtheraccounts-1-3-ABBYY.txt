Auf Wiedersehen, Beloved Mim
Tuesday Night, Nov. 26, 1912
Darling Gopher -	This voyage is almost over; - We are due in Na
in the morning at the crude hour of six, though we don’t have to ge until considerably later. But, presumably, there will be bumpings bangings and yellings from five on so that sleep will be wooed in v The voyage has been a good one as voyages go. This steamer is very and most remarkably steady; the service is excellent, willing and mi courteous; and as for the Table you could stuff until you burst if y were so disposed. The menus have included everything the plain Amej has been used to from infancy, as well as everything you never hearc from "Spit-cake" to "Lobskans with dilled cucumber."
After you bade us goodbye that day, which seems so long ago, we reti to our sumptuous stateroom to find it filling up with baskets of fru boxes of flowers, letters, telegrams and books from many of those to 'I	whom	we	have endeared ourselves. One wondrous basket was from Neiso
and Wallace, and a box of chrysanthemums as big as cabbages with ste a yard long was from	.	We	were	an hour late i
sailing, and didn't start till twelve.
<	Our	one disappointment was the thick weather which prevented our hr.v
anything more than very unsatisfactory glimpses of the Azores, But OhI ..Gibral tar J The Sister-Kitty says she has written you all about but I doubt if even her fluent pen can give you more than a faint id of the splendour, the grimness and the charm of that wonderful spot. We did so hanker for you, - and Jones was the first to sav it aloud, how much he wished you were ther.-.
Yesterday uur first day in the Mediterranean was perfectly beautiful a smooth pale blue sea, and the splendid almost sinister coast of Af: very near, with mountains so high there was snow upon their summits, was after dark when we anchored before Algiers last evening and Cous: Theodore quite refused to let D. and me go ashore even with the peerless Jones. "They are everyone of them beasts in that town" he said shortly, "There's no knowing what they might say to you". "Not with me there, sir," said Jones. But he wouldn't let us go. However the flashing lights of the town near the water and the soft radiance in J moonlight of tier upon tier of dim, white, closely packed buildings j ing to the crest of the hill was a lovely spectacle from the deck of ship. Today the Mediterranean has been too choppy for perfect beauty but we've had Sardinia with us most of the time with its rocky’ mount?
ranges, fit home for hordes of bandits. Baedecker say’s briefly’ that "public safety is not guaranteed to travellers in Sardinia."

postal from Endless,
Darling Gopher -	The day we got to Naples was simply heavenly.
I posted you a letter from there the minute I reached the Hotel. Also I posted 23 other letters and notes that I’d written on the steamer.
As we were driving from the steamer to our hostelry, the Grand Hotel, Doris and I grinning with delight over everything we saw, our carriage was held up by what at first seemed to be two leaping, shouting brigands who turned out to be Harry Burton and Jim Whittaker. I think I told you on my post card from Naples that Jim came all the way from Florence to meet us. And Giulio Tedeschi sent word that he would have given his sou to come also, but couldn’t leave his sick mother. We had a perfect time that first dayr - it was so beautiful, and I’m wondering why I hated Naples so that long ago time when I was a girl.
After we had seen our quarters at the hotel, we all, except Connie E., went driving along a wonderful mountain road above the city to Posolippo, with ecstatic views. In the afternoon while naps were being taken by the Elders, Jim and Doris and I went to the Aquarium, stopping on our way by the seawall to see a lot of fishermen drawing in a seine. They’ did it with a rythmic stamping of the feet and wild shouts and as much enthusiasm as though they’ did not do it twice every’ day’ of their lives.
The Aquarium is wonderful - such extraordinary’ denizens of the deep, and all from the Mediterranean. Later in the afternoon we all went to Bertolini’s for tea. First you drive zigzagging up and up a mountainous road. Then you leave your carriage and walk by means of a tunnel into the heart of the mountain. There you take a lift and go up for
what seems a mile, whereupon you step out on a verandah that seems like XK a terrace in the skies, with the city far below, - the bay, with

Vesuvius to the left and Capri, the Benutiful, in the near distance guarding the entrance to the harbor; and, to the right a dull red classic sunset burning behind a sloping row of cypresses and pines. j was so beautiful it was hurd to believe it true. The next day was hoj-weather and the only thing of interest that we did was the museum, to which Jim and Doris and I went in the morning. But there is never-failing amusement from the windows of the Grand, which is close to the water, with a constant drilling of soldiers in the street by day, and minstrelsy by night.

We boarded this steamer at about 10:30 Friday A.M. in the midst of the; wildest confusion (I fancy it’s always that way in this voluble and excitable land). Jim came down to say goodbye and then betook himself; to his train. We were to have sailed at 12 but were two hours late because of a {gruesome accident. They were lowering a huge bale of sacks of potatoes into the hold when it escaped a guiding hand and smashed a poor man to death against the side of the steamer.
As we sailed out past Capri and the cosst of Italy unfolded "where the: waves and mountains meet", it was a sight of breathless beauty. We were, unfortunately, asleep when we passed through the Straits of Mess Today vTe have had a dim, dim glimpse of Crete, and it's getting delici ously warm. We are due in Alexandria about noon tomorrow, and should be in Cairo in time for dinner. Harry Burton is too amusing for words He is a most delightful addition to our party. I only wish he were going to live on the dahabeah instead of up in the Valley. All blessi on your dear head. I think you ought to give something to some poor person for Christmas; - a turkey sent to Mrs. Tornberg, 90 Wrolcott St.j would be a charity indeed and could be ordered before you leave for Cleveland.
I thought of you at Pomfret Thanksgiving Day. It was hard to realizej in Naples, (with nothing at all to mark the day except the many, mnny things we have to be thankful for), that in our native land, Turkey and Cranberry were reigning supreme.
I meant to stop this letter on the lost sheet with my benediction. N<
I must, in order to write to your grandmother.
Your loving, loving
Mim,
Please wrrite to your grandmother at Christmas time. It’s possible sfr may be in Indianapolis at the time, but "Gambier, Ohio" will always reach her.
