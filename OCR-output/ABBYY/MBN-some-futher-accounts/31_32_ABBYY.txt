Your letter telling of all your Colorado Springs doings you had seen was most interesting. It was revealed to of lightening (truly) during a ferocious and appalling night that I had wholly forgotten to charge you to hunt Colo. Springs. Hence my costly wire.

My head is feeling so queer I think I must put it to bed. I’m much too old and too important to work the way I do. Please hurry up an be a mining King so that I may be surrounded by vassals and serfs well as covered with ropes of pearls.

Best Beloved -	Something so dreadful has happened - I ca
bear to tell you. Jones, dear Jones killed himself four nights ago The Reef. He had been having trouble with his head »nd he must gav gone crazy for the time. He shot himself in the hall outside of hi and the servants found him in the early morning. I think it would killed ConsLn Theodore too had he known the whole truth. Put they him Jones was very ill and had gone home, and the next day chey tol him there was no hope, — and then that he was dead. I have few fri anywhere that I would mourn for more. You have no idea the things did for	me	last	winter - nobody ever in	my life took	care	of	me	lik
that, -	and always begging to be allowred	to do more.	And	in	all	my
I have known few men as worthy of admiration and affection as Jones
It seems a	long	time since I heard from	you. I hope	nothing	is	the
matter.	I	have	postponed going to Ohio	till October.
Endless love. Mother.

Newport, R.i. Oct. 1^, 1 Best Beloved - There is nothing to write about here, but I’m afraid won’t get any letters from you unless I send an occasional one to y and letters to:me now are food to the starving. The weather has be
and is simply hideous, so that your Uncle is housebound and we play cards and dominoes from morning till night, never stopping in the evening until eleven P.M. The one thing that keeps me from going Crazy is that I sleep at night as though I had been clubbed.
I had a note from Mrs. Luckraft yesterday in which she said: "Isabel will undoubtedly write me how fascinating Roger is that you and Doris love him so."
Please take pity on your loving Mim and write to her.

Best Beloved -	I regret to say that the pin forBob Campbell is
in my safety deposit box at the bank and that I cannot put my hand on the key. You'll just have to tell him about it, and send it to him later unless the enclosed permit works. It is possible the men at the bank can open my box (it's a new one in their new vaults) without my key. I think there are two stickpins. The one for Bob is the greeny-blue one, not the yellow one.
Life drags on here in clouds and rain and gloom. I love you very much and hope you are well and happy. Your loving
Mim.

3esi Beloved -	This is just to tell you how dear you were on
Sunday. Doris spoke of it, too. You made your house very happy. If you can possibly manage to get two more tickets to the Princeton game (for which I will pay) I can secure a young man to take Isabel and then I can go with you. Said young man is Chilton Powell, a sort of cousin of mine, an instructor at Columbia, and an awfully nire fellow. He was dining here last night and I sounded him about the garrc, in ca se I could get tickets, and he'll be tickled to death to come. Please let me know (Gambier) as soon as you can, what the prospects are so that I can let him know officially.
Best love, darling, from Your Mim.

Best Beloved -	Yesterday	in	Cleveland	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Eells	spent
an hour trying to	make	me say that I would	go to Egypt with them. I
finally agreed to	let	them know as soon as	I could hear from	you. I
did not tell them	that	I would go if you were willing; but I	did say
that it was matters in	connection with you	that stood in the	way of
my accepting their invitation. If you are willing I would like to go. If you are not willing I do not want to go. The reason why I do not
