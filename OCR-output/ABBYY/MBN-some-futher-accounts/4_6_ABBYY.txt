Entering Alexandria was one of the most beautiful things I ever did,-nnd the scenes on the wharf - the strange tribes and peoples, the wonderful colors, the turbans, the fezes, the Turkish trousers and gold embroidery, the superb figures of the Arabs in their long straight robes, the vociferations and gesticulations, - it was all n mad and wholly delightful confusion. None of us ever have to look after a single piece of our forty-some thing pieces of luggage, except one small black bag with Cousin Emma’s jewels. Jones and Amelie look after everything, and we simply sail along empty-handed and take possession of comfortable train-compartments reserved in large red letters for "Davis Pasha". Cousin Theodore has been coming to this hotel for 20 years so we are a sort of Royal Part}' here and are the recipients of mort salaaming and devotion than anything less than Royalty often gets. It was late Monday evening when we reached here, and we vanished at once in' the gorgeous suite reserved for (is. But the next morning as we were standing on the terrace waiting for our motor car, and xvatching monkeys and cobras and mongooses performing on the sidewalk, who should fall upon us from the rear but Mrs. Tonzalin and Charlotte.
We have been to the museum and have seen the wonderful Theodore M. Davis Room -with all its marvels and beauties, and have been presented (Doris and I) to Sir Gaston Maspero who presented us with the freedom of the Museum, and gave us each a grey and gold permit "de visiter tous les monuments, fermes ou enclos de la Haute-Egypte." We have visited our dahabenh, the Beduin, twice and are wild about it. Once, when the Elders were napping, Harry Burton, D. & I paid a delirious visit to the native bazaars and saw more queer things in an hour than in all our live put together before. WTe have heen to the Pyramids! I I (Haven’t seen the Sphvnx as yet. ) We have motored out and out into the desert until the whole world seemed made of grey and shifting sand in desolate sweeps, high ridges and deep hollows. We've been to the Zoo, - one of the nicest ones 1 ever saw. We’ve been to the Citadel, and have entered the wonderful Mosque of Mohammed Ali with sacred yellow slippers as big as barges on our profane tootsies. But after all it is the strange and crowded and kaleidoscopic street life which is the most enthralling part of Cairo to us so far. Such startling sights which no one but such as we even torn to look at. Doris could ride through Cairo an a camel and not begin to attract the attention she does in New Haven on a horse.
A splendid Arab in a long straight robe of heavenly blue strides across a thoroughfare with three dried crocodiles under his arm and 615 Orange St, is the only thing that notices him. It's all of it perfectly gorgeous.
But we hanker to hear from you. I've had a letter from Adeline, one fre Grandmother, and one from Katie from Cooraclare, Ireland; and D. has had missives from Marion and Clara. Perhaps the next steamer w'ill bring one from you. I omitted to send a message - a Christmas message for Clara to enclose with my present to you. But you know - or ought -what oceans and oceans of love go with it.
God bless my boy and keep him safe. A Merrv Christmas and A Truly Happy New Year.
Your loving Mother

Darling Gopher - The ca-fele which John sent rae telling of his father's death was five days late in being delivered to me. I cabled at once t<j Auntie Paige, and of course followed that message immediately by a lett If they telegraphed you I do hopcyou did the proper thing. I cannot feeling very anxious about Paige. She has been under such a tremendous strain for so long that I'm afraid under the sudden cessation of it she 3 may	go to pieces.	Of course you will go to	see her	at once in Clevel^
and	I beg you to write me at once all about	her. I	hope	Winifred has
taken the baby to Cleveland. Nothing in the world coiid divert Paige or help her as much as that baby.
Your letter of the 21 Nov. reached me Saturday the 7th and rejoiced me through and through. I'm also glad that you have decided to live at th Hall - if it is not going to interfere with your work and keep you up too	late at night.	As to your surgical operation,	I do	not anticipate
any	trouble at all	from that. Nevertheless	I shall	want	a line immedia,
tely - sooner than you will feel like writing it; so arrange with the doctor or one of your friends to write me at once. If it were a more serious thing I should, of course, want a cable.	j
We go on living in the Arabian Nights. We had tea yesterday afternoon on the dahabenh, with the most wonderful lights on the river-that haunt ing river Nile; white walled palaces, backed by towering palm trees, gleaming out on the opposite shore; a fleet of boats with their beautir ful, slanting sails moving so slowly that they seemed not to move at *1 until suddenly you found they had vanished around a bend. Before our guests arrived we were immensely amused by a little scene enacted on ( bank to which the Beduin is tied. We have a snow-white cock and three hens, a gorgeous drake and three ducks which we take with us when we set sail, and which made the voyage up the river last year. The ducks were off visiting a neighboring dahabeah yesterday when we arrived, but when whistled for came paddling up for dear life. In the meantime the, cock and hens had wandered along the bank till they arrived at the plm close to the boat, which the drake regards as his own domain. Instant! the drake waddled out of the water and made for the cock, dabbing at h: legs until he drove him off. Tn his pride of victory and the attitude he struck he really' looked like Napoleon.
Our. guests were Prof. Sayrle, an Oxford Don, explorer and scientist, Artirr Pasha, an Armenian'archa eologist of distinction, and an Egyptian gentleman, Claudius Bey, whose hair turned snow white a few yeors ago when upon going on board a steamer, just landed at Alexandria, to meet his wife - he found her lying in her stateroom with her throat cut.
She had been murdered by a steward.
I talked with Prof. Say'le for some time, or rather I listened while he talked. He told me some inside history' about Gordon, which was absorb-ingly interesting, - particularly' so to me as Gordon has always been of of my' heroes. Ve had expected to move onto the dahabeah today' and sail tomorrow but we've been delayed a day. Not that I care - for I've not begun to see the wonders of this city-. After church yesterdfiv morning

Harry' Burton find I went to see the Blue Mosque, -a be?iutiful, half ruinet structure, parts of whose walls are covered with superb Persian tiles in blue and white. Hundreds of young men ?md boys were sitting about in groups on the floor reciting the Koran aloud. The weather is heavenly.
-e wear our winter clothes and Cousin Theodore declares it cold, but I am basking in warmth, except in the evening.
Give my dear love to Mr. and Mrs. Eells and the young people. The Sister-Kittie is in high favor and I am very happy.
A Happy, Happy New Year to you my darling.

Darling Gopher -	This is the best paper and I shall not use it
often in wrriting to you, but am giving you a treat as long as this is my first letter to you from the boat. I’d give anything if you were here. It is impossible to convey by written description any adequate idea of t incomparable river find the scenes through which it winds. And how it winds! \ve almost ... the compass in our meandering, And it would take a whole day’s writing, and result in a letter you would ceirry about with you - possibly - but never read, if I tried to describe the variety of scenery. The principal towns are on the west shore, and it is on that shore that the railroad from Cairo to Luxor runs, and there is enough of ceaseless interest on that side to hold you spellbound fiom the cool early' morning through the glow'ing day tothe moonlit dusk. But it’s nothing to the Eastern Shore with its desert stretches, its cultivated str and terraces, its palm groves, its native villages so absolutely' fascinating that each one fills me with delight, some of them are walled abou and those always have towering palms growing within the walls; the unwalled ones are sometimes hard to distinguish from the desert sand out of which they' rise and the desert hills into which they' melt without one speck of anything green about them. And always on that magic Eastern Shore the fierce Arabian hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, sometimes far in the distance, sometimes in the foreground. Absolutely' bleak find bare, of the strangest shapes, long stretches of them where surely no human foot has ever been, then long stretches where they' have been quarried for building stone, or tunnelled for tombs. Yesterday morning we sailed close to the foot of gigantic limestone cliffs that rose precipitously' out of the river, where men in white robes clinging t ledges were prying off great blocks of rock that came rolling find crc>shi to the water’s edge to be loaded on barges. The sunlight on this scene made a blinding glare. Ang the people - the picturesque people - no X stretch so barren but that you can always see those stately' shrouded figures, working in the fields, at the Shadufs, fishing, sitting motionless brooding by the river, pray'ing with their faces to the East, women filling their water jars and striding up the bank with the full jars on their heads, disdaining to touch them even with one hand, people going and coming along the road - on foot, on donkeys, on camels (always camels and donkeys everywhere), flocks feeding by the shore shepherded'
by' one or two cloaked and hooded figures. And on the river itself great barges loaded with cotton, with grain, with water jars packed so that they look like cream colored cannon balls, - or merely boats filled wit!
