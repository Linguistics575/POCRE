V'e had a wonderful mail today, but no letter from you. Ke had a wonderful ride this afternoon, Cousin T. , D. &■ I. over to Medinet Habu, near the foot of the mountains, where there are the most beautiful ruins we've seen yet.
Goodnight, Darling, and God bless my boy.
Your Loving Mim
West Bank at Luxor - 10 JanuDrjr 1913
Darling Gopher -	It's more than two weeks since I've heard from
you and I'm beginning to be afraid that a letter must have been lost.
As for me I've written you with the utmost regularity, beginning with a postal from Gib, followed by a letter mailed the minute I arrived in Naples on the 27th, pursued by another mailed at Alexandria Dec. 2, since which I’ve written once a week. A letter just arrived from Jack Stewrart and written on Christmas day says "I suppose Roger has written you of his visit to Savannah with Bill Hunter". Of course I am wholly mystified. Unless a letter comes from you soon, my feeling of remoteness will begin to be intolerable.
Things go on happening here with the most delightful frequency and the day7s flit by on the wings of the wind. I bask in constant sunlight, and wear summer clothes, and am beginning to look so young that Cousin Theodore persistently refers to me, when speaking to Doris, as "Your sister". Our most recent excitement is a note arrived from Harry7 Burton this morning before breakfast saying that he had found (in a new sepulchral chamber he opened a few days ago) a red granite sarcophagus with a recumbent figure carved on the lid. The note further said it would take about two days to clear away the debris in which it is embedded, Cousin Theodore, Doris and Jones are going to ride over to the valley tomorrow afternoon and spend the night, and await developments.
I want to go also, but it isn't fair to leave Cousin Emma alone so I'm going to stay7 with her. I think I shall ride part way' with them for the sake of the ride, and then come back alone with Mahmoud, myr donkey7 boy7 - and possibly one of the crew. When Cousin T. , D. & I go out we a r> quite a cavalcade - we three mounted, and three donkey boyrs and two sailors running beside us. I've come to the reluctant conclusion that my7 donkey7, Sugar, has too small a tummy to cinch a sidesaddle to. My saddle is continually turning and I have to dismount and hold up the procession and have it readjusted. Jones thought it might be the fault of the saddle, and, in his determination to have me suited, the other day7 he, assited by7 two donkey boys and six of the crew, saddled and unsaddled that one small donkey with various sidesaddles while all Luxor looked on. But no sidesaddle stay7s put for more than fifteen minutes on Sugar, so I think I'll have to give him up. I hate to,- he's so pretty and cunning and makes me think of Kim.
Sunday afternoon we took a rather unusual ride, not visiting any ruins (which is what we almost always do) but riding through miles of cultivated fields where steam ployghs were at work ?vnd the water flowing through cemented irrigating ditches,- all more modern and progressive than anything we have seen, and quite dull and uninteresting compared with the native methods.
