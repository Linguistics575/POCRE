different from those of Edward and his mother. I'm very flattered that you "had a wonderful time" reading all that manuscript in a bunch. I'm so very sorry you missed that lecture by Mr. Mercer, and ] would love to have had you meet him. I never knew him myself, but Edv and Grace knew him, and were there part of the time with him, if I'm not mistaken. I wish I knew whether the mines are paying and whether its Mrs. Twombly who is doing the mining now that her husband is dead. The Milligan Mining Co. of which your uncle is President is the "Keweenaw Land Association, and I only wish I had some stock in it.
I'm still somewhat lame from my rheumatism, so that I've been on my donkey only once in almost three weeks. That was last Monday and it started up the pain in my leg again so that I've had to forego riding since. It makes me wild to miss so much time and lose so many opporti nities, but I *m glad it's I and not Doris - for the years have, as the ought, brought something of the philosophic mind to me, and I don't mi it as much as she would. She; and Cousin T. rode over to the diggings this afternoon and brought back interesting news. Harry has been excavating a palace of Rarneses III and has found some very extraordinary windows (it was not supposed they had windows in that period) and alsc a couple of bathrooms. I went for a long walk with a sailor to take care of me, - a little too long, for the home stretch through heavy sand was about all I could manage.
Just before we arrived in Africa I said one day to Doris that I imegir we'd meet so many people we knew that the Kile would be like Chapel Si She promptly bet me $5 that we wouldn't meet more than three sets of people that we knew. She has lost, of course, more than twice over. They’ve been quite thick recently. Saturday a.m. Doris and Janet Dodg cavorted about Karnak together, and in the afternoon I had the Dodge family to tea at the Winter Palace. Sunday after church I had a litt] chat with Mrs. Daniel Eaton of Sachem Street, Tuesday a.m. Mrs. Eatoi came to call; Tuesday afternoon thet nice Mr. Weston (you remember hir first in Newport and then in Paris) turned up; find that night fit the c at the Winter Palace Doris bostoned most of the evening with Newton 3} and saw the Romeyns. Wednesday' I went over to coll on the Romeyns, ai Mrs. R. must have been really glad to see me because she kissed me. 1 left for Aswan the next morning, but we shall see them again in Cairo if not before. I took tea with Mr. Weston Wednesday at the W. Palace, ne asked a great deal about you and wanted me to be sure to give you his warm regards. He has been a, full-fledged Prof, at Williams for tl years now,
I had already written to Manson & Co. before your letter came asking them to send you a check for $125. If that isn’t enough to cover you'i Christmfis expenses write me what I still owe you.
We are off on Saturday for Aswan. Up to March 20 send letters as heretofore - Shepheard’s, Cairo. After that care Theo. M. Davis, Esq-; Messrs. Morgan, Harjes & Co. Paris, France.
Please give Crosson Hay's my' love and tell him it is splended to hear I of courage like his. I think he is probably made of the same sort of stuff as that superb Captain Oates in the South Pole party', who after suffering for weeks without a murmur walked out into the blizzard and
