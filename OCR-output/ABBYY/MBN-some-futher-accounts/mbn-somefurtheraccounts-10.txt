hen the felucca took Doris nnd me	across	the river, end	Harry' Burton
et us nt the steps (he is stopping	at the	Winter	Palace,	there being no
oom for him on the Beduin) and conducted us to the English Church which s away at the rear of a garden filled with palms and acacias and other ovely things, and where an Arab was ringing the bell outside, as they did n "Bunty". And Emily joined us inside. It was very comforting to me o have her to go to church with us this far land on this Day of Days, hen we came back to the Beduin we brought Harry and Mr. Crane (a young nglish artist, son of the better known Walter Crane) to luncheon, fter luncheon they wanted us to go to the Gymkana in the Winter Palace ;ardens, but the Tucks were coming at four for tea so we couldn't. The ucks came and Emily and Miss Nelson and Major Curley, and they were :razy about the boat, and we had a	lovely	time.	They go	on their way	to
airo tomorrow at one.	We had	such a	perfectly enormous
inner tonight with only' the four of us to eat it that by the time the :urkey arrived we could only look at it regretfully, and have it carried iff unscathed, for we had to eat plum pudding. Jones having heard me emark that I was going to break over my total abstinence on Christmas in irder to drink a toast to you, had supplied chnmpagr,a from the wine :ellar, wherever that may be. The Cousins never touch champagne, so Joris and I drank alone to "our son and brother", and then I drank a :oraprehensive toast to "all the people I love".
Te had a splendid mail awaiting us when we got back from church this norning. It was so good to have it come on Christmas Day. I do hope rou got my first letter very soon after you sent yours. I think I explained in it that people told us on no account to post letters at Gib. jecause it sometimes took months for them to reach their destinations froi there. So I only mailed you a postcard from there & sent my first letter 'rom Naples the minute we landed on the 27th.
Dec. 26th. Doris and I mounted on our gallant donkey's, (mine is named Sugar) and followed by our donkey' boy's (mine is named Mahmoud) rode off this morning towards the Liby'an mountains, the object of our visit being the Colossi - see picture enclosed, which stand not far from their foot. The figures are 52feet in height; the slab pedestals on which their thrones and feet rest are 13ft in height, making the entire height 65 ft. Sven in this land of mighty' marvels they seem all that there is of the a ‘ traordinary'.	Well, dearest, dozens of other letters must be
written, so fere thee well for now.
Endless love and many' blessings on your belove head.
Your very7 own Mim

The principal thing that has occurred since myr last week's letter to you was our visit to the Valley. \v'e all went out last Friday', Doris,
Cousin T. and Jones riding, and Cousin E and I driving. It's seven miles. I meant to ride also, but I found Cousin Emma hated to drive
