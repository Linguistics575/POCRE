Then she staid for Christmas, and now she is staying on througl February just because she likes it.

Nothing particularly thrilling has happened since my last letter. The! chief destination of our rides for the past week has been our new digg: at Medinet Iiabu which is much nearer than the old diggings at the Tomb; of the Kings. Doris and I rode over there yesterday afternoon to cheei Harry up a bit. He occasionally gets tired of not seeing o white pers< to speak to for days at a time. I sat on a block of stone that hnd on< been part of a temple pillar, and Doris wandered about picking up chun] of carnelian, and my donkey boy took his clothes off - just why I cann< say, Fortunately he put them on again. On leaving Harry to his diggii we rode up into a hollow in the Libyan Hills to see a temple we had nol yet visited - a gem of a temple, called Der-el-Medineh. The view nloni off towards the Nile through a wide cleft in the rocks was worth going far to see. And the superb looking Arab, guardian of the place, was s< moved by my present of seven cents that he knocked Mahmoud, my donkey 1 out of the way and held my donkey himself while I mounted. On our horai ward way Doris left me on a mac/ gallop to catch up to a baby camel sh< saw in the distance. The maternal camel was not pleased by' this attention and tried to take a bite out of Doris, but, happily, failed.
I’ve been twice out to luncheon this week - once with the Fahnestocks on their Dahabya "Cheops", and once at the Winter Palace with the Piers The Piers are enchanting people and so nice to us. They had Doris ove: for dinner and the dance again Tuesday night. It is such a pleasure t< her and I’m so thankful she can have it. The incessant cardplaying is rather hard on her. I tru to help out by play'ing dominoes as much as I can; but Cousin T. so much prefers bridge.
Give my special love to Jack and tell him I live in hopes of finding t: to ansver his letter as it deserves. My love to Wilson Foss. And, dearest, to please me, bo and call on Mrs. Baker. It isn’t decent not to when she has been so kind about asking you there.
I made a mistake in saying it had been two weeks since I had a letter from you. It’s only a little over one. God bless my boy. I have timi of being very homesick for you.
Your loving Mim.

Darling Gopher -	Your letter of Jan l6th came two or three days \
ago with its accounts of the Prom. It was awfully nice for you, as well as for her, that Edith made such a hit. I judge from what you anj others have written that this year’s Prom was more per-fervid than any| that ever was before. It’s a pity to let it become an insane orgy - f| that will eventually' kill it. It was quite nolie of you to write to me| so soon and shen you were still so nearly dead with fatigue. I enclos the order on the bank which you asked for, and I put in the P.S. just I just to remind you not to absent-mindedly carryr off the key.
