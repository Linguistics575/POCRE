Darling Gopher -	This is the best paper and I shall not use it
often in wrriting to you, but am giving you a treat as long as this is my first letter to you from the boat. I’d give anything if you were here. It is impossible to convey by written description any adequate idea of t incomparable river find the scenes through which it winds. And how it winds! \ve almost ... the compass in our meandering, And it would take a whole day’s writing, and result in a letter you would ceirry about with you - possibly - but never read, if I tried to describe the variety of scenery. The principal towns are on the west shore, and it is on that shore that the railroad from Cairo to Luxor runs, and there is enough of ceaseless interest on that side to hold you spellbound fiom the cool early' morning through the glow'ing day tothe moonlit dusk. But it’s nothing to the Eastern Shore with its desert stretches, its cultivated str and terraces, its palm groves, its native villages so absolutely' fascinating that each one fills me with delight, some of them are walled abou and those always have towering palms growing within the walls; the unwalled ones are sometimes hard to distinguish from the desert sand out of which they' rise and the desert hills into which they' melt without one speck of anything green about them. And always on that magic Eastern Shore the fierce Arabian hills which follow us all the way to Luxor, sometimes far in the distance, sometimes in the foreground. Absolutely' bleak find bare, of the strangest shapes, long stretches of them where surely no human foot has ever been, then long stretches where they' have been quarried for building stone, or tunnelled for tombs. Yesterday morning we sailed close to the foot of gigantic limestone cliffs that rose precipitously' out of the river, where men in white robes clinging t ledges were prying off great blocks of rock that came rolling find crc>shi to the water’s edge to be loaded on barges. The sunlight on this scene made a blinding glare. Ang the people - the picturesque people - no X stretch so barren but that you can always see those stately' shrouded figures, working in the fields, at the Shadufs, fishing, sitting motionless brooding by the river, pray'ing with their faces to the East, women filling their water jars and striding up the bank with the full jars on their heads, disdaining to touch them even with one hand, people going and coming along the road - on foot, on donkeys, on camels (always camels and donkeys everywhere), flocks feeding by the shore shepherded'
by' one or two cloaked and hooded figures. And on the river itself great barges loaded with cotton, with grain, with water jars packed so that they look like cream colored cannon balls, - or merely boats filled wit!
