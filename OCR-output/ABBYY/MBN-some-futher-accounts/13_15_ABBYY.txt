Tuesday night Doris and I made our first plunge into Luxor society. There are some perfectly charming Americans, Mr. and Mrs. Garret Pier, staying at the Winter Palace, find they invited D. & me to dine and stay for the regular Tuesday evening dance. It was such a fascinatin; way to go to dinner, - to step into an immaculate felucca and go skim: down the starlit river with six white durba.113 bowing rhythmically bef< us as the men bent to their oars; then to be escorted by two of our a bearing lanterns, up to the entrance of the hotel, and to find them, standing like statues fiwaiting us when we left the hotel at eleven. Doris met some awfully amusing young Englishmen, two or three of whom could actually dance well, and I enjoyed myself immensely just tnlkin to people.
We’ve just had a Baron find Baroness Von Bissing lunching with us. He is a sort of German translation of Leonard Bacon. The resemblance is too amusing. We see by the Paris Herald that George Bourne has been married. I wonder if he will come out here on his wedding journey.
You will now be able to tell me something of Mrs. Moses. I’ve writte twice without getting an answer to either missive. I cannot underst? it. Please be sure to send me her new' address, though I should thinh Savannah, Georgia would reach her. And have you been to see Kim? Please go I I can’t bear to have him forget his family’’. Dr. Nolte i: the name, and you can find the'.address in the telephone book.
Endless love from us both and please write to your adoring
Mim.
I hope you wrote to your grandmother at Christmas time. If you have: done so, do it nowr for my sake. She wrote me she sent you a couple books.

Darling Gopher -	Your	letter of the 8th arrived today, - fift
days is pretty' quick work, the quickest possible I fancy. I was ewf glad to get it, and I am also glad to be able to tell you that its quite all	right with Mr. Eells as well as	with	Mrs., for I	had a fir
long letter from him on Sunday expressing	much	disappointment, but r
traces of	annoyance at your failure to come to	Cleveland.	He is so
sensitive	I was afraid he might think you	*/ent	to Savannah	merely be
cause you preferred to. Congratulations on having passed your exam: also on having done the nice thing at Christmas by' Kan, and others i your grandmother. By' the way, did you really' - as ma.n to man, mind, like your waistcofit? Doris and I had an argument over it. She mail you would think it vulgarly loud, while I insisted that there was nc in getting a fancy waistcoat unless it was fancy', and I thought it 1 go very well with the Oxford grey' clothes I made you get. Bud TalL had already', in a letter to hie, broken the horrid news about Lefty' ' Cloister has certainly' got a black eyre this winter, nicht wahr?
Various exciting things have happened "all in the blue, unclouded w since my last letter. On Sunday' Doris and Cousin T. , mounted on th donkey's and accompanied by the peerless Jones, basely' deserted Cous
' I
Emma and me and trotted over to the Valley to spend the night* while we-, had to sit tamely on deck like perfect ladies, and dispense tea and cakes to strange Americans from Buffalo whom we had never seen before.
Sir Gaston Maspero was to join them the next morning at the Tombs and pronounce judgement on the red granite sarcophagus. The next afternoon 1 had just got back from a long walk (accompanied by a sailor with a heavy stick,) packed with fleas which I had annexed in a native village I suddenly found myself in; and was having tea on deck in company with th< Contessa Contardone and Mr. Tremaine when the cavalcade returned from the Volley. It had quite the effect in a mild way of explorers returning from the African desert as they came in single file across the sands; fir the sumpter mule (so to speak) with the luggage, then Cousin T., Doris & Jones with the donkey boys running beside thenp, and Julius Caesar braying his head off as they came. Doris was beaming. She had had the most wonderful time with Maspero who had lunched with them in the House in the Valley and who talked as she never had heard anyone talk before.
He pronounced the sarcophagus a treasure, wants it for the Museum in Cairo, but also wants Cousin Theodore to pay the insignificant sum of 250 poinds sterling for its transportation therej
The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic the next day at the great temple of Medinet Habu, to see the magic performances of a noted Arab snake-charmer she had persuaded to come down from Esneh for the purpose. We went, and it was an extraordinary experience. (Doris had a nasty spill on the way out. Her donkey stepped into a pitfall, flung her, fell on her and kicked her, but she insisted on going on, with her usual pluck, and in the end suffered no serious effects). I simply haven't time to give you an account of what happened at the ruins. It was both dramatic and astounding. The Arab stalking in front of the picnic, who all straggled after him, recited some sort of incantation in a loud clear voice, and lured snakes from out of thornbushes on the desert and the coy cobra from chinks in the temple wall.
Yesterday I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace and carried off a cup (the 1st Prize),- not by my own prowess but by that of my partner, a very nice Scotchman named MacNaughton who played a corking game.
This afternoon D. & I went over there again on invitation to watch a rather mild but quite amusing gymkhana, and enjoyed ourselves immensely. And now I must turn in and get some of that sleep that 1 seem to require more here than anywhere else in the world.	I	suppose	now	you
cannot gret that operation done till the Spring vacation. I wonder if postponing it was wise.
Oceans of love, dearest, from
Your Mim.

Darling Gopher -	We	are	now	wondering	whether Edith was allowed
to return to New Haven for the Prom proper. In a letter Doris had from Dick he said he had met you on the street and you had told him of your hopes and fears (though he didn't put it that way.) I have a feeling that she did come back. I fancy' Mrs. Pinch likes now and then to make a bluff at being very strict and keep people in suspense, I shall await your description of the Prom with interest and such patience as I can summon to my aid. It's two weeks since I've had a letter from you.
I was rejoiced yesterday by one from Golden from Mrs. Moses, which
I
combined the advantages of a long-desired missive from a friend end a puzzle. She writes one of the most indecipherable hands I’ve ever encountered. It seems Put had a very serious accident in football end a time was in a dangerous condition. That was what first took her out there. Then she staid for Christmas, and now she is staying on througl February just because she likes it.

Nothing particularly thrilling has happened since my last letter. The! chief destination of our rides for the past week has been our new digg: at Medinet Iiabu which is much nearer than the old diggings at the Tomb; of the Kings. Doris and I rode over there yesterday afternoon to cheei Harry up a bit. He occasionally gets tired of not seeing o white pers< to speak to for days at a time. I sat on a block of stone that hnd on< been part of a temple pillar, and Doris wandered about picking up chun] of carnelian, and my donkey boy took his clothes off - just why I cann< say, Fortunately he put them on again. On leaving Harry to his diggii we rode up into a hollow in the Libyan Hills to see a temple we had nol yet visited - a gem of a temple, called Der-el-Medineh. The view nloni off towards the Nile through a wide cleft in the rocks was worth going far to see. And the superb looking Arab, guardian of the place, was s< moved by my present of seven cents that he knocked Mahmoud, my donkey 1 out of the way and held my donkey himself while I mounted. On our horai ward way Doris left me on a mac/ gallop to catch up to a baby camel sh< saw in the distance. The maternal camel was not pleased by' this attention and tried to take a bite out of Doris, but, happily, failed.
I’ve been twice out to luncheon this week - once with the Fahnestocks on their Dahabya "Cheops", and once at the Winter Palace with the Piers The Piers are enchanting people and so nice to us. They had Doris ove: for dinner and the dance again Tuesday night. It is such a pleasure t< her and I’m so thankful she can have it. The incessant cardplaying is rather hard on her. I tru to help out by play'ing dominoes as much as I can; but Cousin T. so much prefers bridge.
Give my special love to Jack and tell him I live in hopes of finding t: to ansver his letter as it deserves. My love to Wilson Foss. And, dearest, to please me, bo and call on Mrs. Baker. It isn’t decent not to when she has been so kind about asking you there.
I made a mistake in saying it had been two weeks since I had a letter from you. It’s only a little over one. God bless my boy. I have timi of being very homesick for you.
Your loving Mim.

Darling Gopher -	Your letter of Jan l6th came two or three days \
ago with its accounts of the Prom. It was awfully nice for you, as well as for her, that Edith made such a hit. I judge from what you anj others have written that this year’s Prom was more per-fervid than any| that ever was before. It’s a pity to let it become an insane orgy - f| that will eventually' kill it. It was quite nolie of you to write to me| so soon and shen you were still so nearly dead with fatigue. I enclos the order on the bank which you asked for, and I put in the P.S. just I just to remind you not to absent-mindedly carryr off the key.
