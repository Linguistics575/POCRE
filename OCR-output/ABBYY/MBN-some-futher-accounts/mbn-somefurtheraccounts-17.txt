Luxor - 1*+ February, 1913
Darling Gopher -	You	are	my best and only Valentine, and I wish
you were here or I were there to tell you so, viva voce. I have notl interesting to record this time of my personal doings because my who] week has been given up to homesickness and rheumatism. I have suffej torments with sciatic.* or neuritis or some kindred diabolical disease in my left leg} and I've not been off the boat since going to church last Sunday morning. To make matters worse the sun - the brilliant, constant, revivifying Egyptian sun - has withdrawn its light for two whole days, and it actually rained all day yesterday, resulting in t] damp and cold and gloom on which rheumatism thrives. But I’m glad il not Doris who is stricken down be her old enemy, If she had to bear in addition to her daily task of Bridge I think she’d go crazy.
Day before yesterday when she came back from a morning across the rii at Luxor she announced that Ex-President Diaz with a party of "greasy looking Mexicans" was tied up over there in a gorgeous dnhabya. He must be glad he is here instead of in his war-tossed native land.
Mr. J. P. Morgan is also tied up over there on his boat, and rumor h; it that the Great Man is as cross as two sticks (he may be having a left leg, also) and making the lives of his guests a burden to them.
We expect to leave here March 1st for Aswan, and I presume we shall find ourselves in Cairo again about March 15th. Mr. Rudy’ard Kipling there now. I hope ray next communication to you will contain more th:
The love I send you is endless
Your Mim.

I am still more or less; crippled from rheumatism, and it will be two weeks tomorrow since I 1 pleasure of riding my’ donkey'. It makes me chafe to think of how mucl I might have seen in that time, and now our day's here are numbered, as we start for Aswan a week from tomorrow. I do hope the Romeyns will get here before then, - or we may' see them farther up the river;, Last Monday' I left the boat for the first time in eight day's and the) only' to go across the river to see if electricity would do my aching* leg any' good. Tuesday I went again for the same purpose and on ray' rf found Newton By'ers sitting on deck talking to the Sister-Kitty’! I w| much more glad to see him than I’ve ever been before, and Wednesday f afternoon I went over to the steamer Raineses III and called on his I mother and sister. His mother is just a nice, plain mother, but hi4 sister struck me as something quite lovely and fine and rare, which I opinion is cordially’ seconded by' the carping and critical D, Newberif
