We’ve hud to make some plans for the summer - though they can be bro if they do not prove best. Doris wants very much to go to Castine I’ve written to engage three rooms there. But what I do when summer' really comes depends mainly on what you do. Only one must have un anchor to windward.

We've haunted bazaars and done errands and had some swagger clothes made (for which your uncle insisted on paying; - but we wouldn't havt had them otherwise), and had visitors and gone to teas, and revelled in street sights, and I've seen the Khedive and almost seen Lord Kitchener but not quite, and have met one of the highest-up men in t] Army here - Major Watson, or Watson Pasha - whichever you choose to call him, who is aide-de-camp to the Khedive. He is an enchanting person and if he weren't already married I should try to get him for Little Sister.
We are sailing Wednesday so my next letter will be from Naples where we expect to spend two days, going thence to Florence. No letter from you since 2 weeks ago, Hope all goes well with you. Endless love from

Alexandria at one after a comfortable trip through such lovely1' scenes I couldn't bear to take my eyes off the windows for a minute. We sailed at 2:30 and are due in Naples at 11 A.M. Saturday. If we are. not late and if the day' is pleasant (it's funny I remembered to say | that after four months of pleasant day's as a matter of course) Harrs is going to take Doris - and me if I can get off - to Pompeii.

I got your letter of Zarch 20th the other day in Naples, just after I had posted mine to you. And your April	1st one re?iched	me here	yesterday. We had to waste one day in	Naples	as it rained so	torrentially,
and practically the sole fruit of our stay there was that Doris saw Pompeii - which was one of her heart's desires. 1 would have liked to see it too, for in the 30 years which have elapsed since I was there much has been excavated. But it	wasn't	possible for us	both to	do it,
and I was crazy to have D. go.	We	got here Tuesday night,	having
left Naples at 9:^5 that morning, with Vesuvius covered a third of the way down from its summit with snow. The cold and the rain here in Italy have been hard to bear after the sunlight and warmth of Egypt. But it is such an entrancing trip here from Naples - such verdant count such beautiful vinyards, such a riot of flowers, the mountains and hills so splended and so romantic with the feudal towns crowning the summits of the foothills and long, long roads leading up to them. On the enclosed card I've marked about where our sitting room windows are, and the bridge you see is the far famed Ponte Vecchio, lined on both sides with the most enthralling shops. Near the bridge this side of the Ponte Vecchio, and which just misses getting into the picture, someone was committing suicide as we drove up to the hotel the night of our arrival.

Darling Gopher	This letter is somewhat belated and I'th sorry. |
We left Florence Monday afternoon, April 28th at five in the afternc and reached here Tuesday night at quarter of eleven; and dearly as ] love England I am now getting so impatient to be home that I have all constant pushing feeling inside of myself. On the Sundays before le?l ing Florence I went to the American Church and encountered the Romef and we walked home together. D. and I also ran across them the nex| morning when we were paying a final visit to the beauties contained-in the church of Santa Croce. Mrs. Romeyn was full of Rad's nobilif in sticking to his job instead of accepting her invitation for him come to Europe for the summer.
