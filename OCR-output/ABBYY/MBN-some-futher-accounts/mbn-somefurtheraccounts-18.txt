Just as I was leaving the boat, nfter calling, I had the thrill of seeing no less a person than Rudyard Kipling, who was a fellow passenger of the Dyers family. Doris dined with the Byers that evening and went out to ICarnak with them to see those matchless ruins by moonlight. The Byers said D. was a perfect godsend, because until that evening their son and brother had not laughed since he left America. He told me he didn't want to come at all - that his family had dragged him.
Yesterday I went over to lunch at the Luxor Hotel with the Contessa di 3 Contardone di Villa Marina. You don't have to call her all tha t - just * Countess or Contessa. She is an Englishwoman who made the mistake of c her life in marrying an Italian, now haply dead, leaving her a widow for the second time.

She is a sister of Sir Mortimer Durand who was ambassador from England to Washington some time ago.

Best Beloved -	Your letter of the 9th has just come and it made
me weep - I feel so awfully" about Crosson Hayes. V.’hat a perfectly" dreadful thing to have happen. The thought of what he must have suffered made me feel so sick I didn't want any" luncheon, and I'm so low in my" mind I'm afraid this wont be a cheerful letter.
And now I want to explain why I've written so much more elaborate letters to Adeline than to you. I knew she was going to miss me more even than you, because she lives such a shut-in life with so few distractions and almost no occupations; and so I have written those letters to her as full and as well as myr very limited leisure permitted. Then, too, I truly" would not quite have dared to write such long screeds to you for fear you wouldn't read them. Very" few young men have the patience to read long letters. Edward Firth told me that he sometimes carried a letter from his mother for a week in his pocket without-reading it. Of course I know you wouldn't do that, for our relations with each other are quite
