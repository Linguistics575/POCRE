We’ve hud to make some plans for the summer - though they can be bro if they do not prove best. Doris wants very much to go to Castine I’ve written to engage three rooms there. But what I do when summer' really comes depends mainly on what you do. Only one must have un anchor to windward.

Best Beloved -get my letters off at 2:30 days. It is now 12:30 and be dashed off at a gallop. Monday was the most wonderf horribly lame for 2 days af would have adored it, - I'd They Keren't -awfully good c of riding fine ones. Harry with some English people on regiment. Said Major furni and Harry said they were pe than the ones we had.
