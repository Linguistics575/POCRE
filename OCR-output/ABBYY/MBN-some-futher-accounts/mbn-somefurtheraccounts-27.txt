Darling Gopher	This letter is somewhat belated and I'th sorry. |
We left Florence Monday afternoon, April 28th at five in the afternc and reached here Tuesday night at quarter of eleven; and dearly as ] love England I am now getting so impatient to be home that I have all constant pushing feeling inside of myself. On the Sundays before le?l ing Florence I went to the American Church and encountered the Romef and we walked home together. D. and I also ran across them the nex| morning when we were paying a final visit to the beauties contained-in the church of Santa Croce. Mrs. Romeyn was full of Rad's nobilif in sticking to his job instead of accepting her invitation for him come to Europe for the summer.
