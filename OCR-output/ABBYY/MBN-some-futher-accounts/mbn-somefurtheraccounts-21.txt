leopard skins and the Soudanese weapons, and the scores of things you* never seen anywhere else.
This morning, immediately after breakfast, D. and I, with Haneen, started for the dam - or the barrage as it's usually called here.
Jones hod engaged a carriage for us at the Cataract Hotel (opposite | which we are lying with only a narrow channel between us), and had a luncheon put up for us in the native basket that looks just like the S square wicker cages birds are kept in at the bird fanciers. In less than five minutes from the time we left that very fine hotel courtyard we were in the desert - and a terrible desert, quite unlike the beaut: ful one at Luxor. Ruined habitations and ruined cemeteries lay along much of the three miles we drove, and it wouldn't have surprised me ii the least, though I would have been white with fear, to have seen lie; stalking about in those desperate solitudes. And then suddenly we were in the midst of an enchanting little cantonment of pretty bunga-: lows, beautiful trees and gardens and verdant terraces, - the settle-1 rnent in which live the officials and chief employees who manage the j barrage. Kv wildest imaginings fell far short of the stunning and bewildering reality. Doris and I elected to walk across the barrage [â–  though most people ride on little individual skeleton cars, each one pushed by a native along a track (there are two tracks). It is a milt a quarter long, and there are 180 sluice gates. On the upper side tht Nile lies like a calm lake within ten feet of the top- of the masonry;-: while on the lower side, at least a hundred feet below and about in the middle of the dam this morning where several adjoining sluices we; open there was a thunder and turmoil of waters and foam almost like Niagara Falls. At the far end of the barrage we took a felucca and sailed over to Philai, once the Island called "the Pearl of Egypt," bi now so drowned by the banking up of the waters, that only the very to] of the palm trees show- above the water which laps the capitals of the pillars of the temple. When we got back to the barrage we walked dowi four or five flights of steps along the locks and found another feluc< awaiting us, which Jones had sent up, and in that we came down the rii We had hoped to sail, but there was such a contrary wind the men rowec the way.
There are a few mere sights to be seen tomorrow, and on Friday we sta; on our return trip. The air is splended here,, but the wind blows too much for my complete happiness.
Goodbye, darling. God bless you and keep you safe. I do so hope you will go to church on Easter.
Your Loving Mother.

Thursday, March 13, 1913 Speeding down the Nile
Best Beloved -	At last we are on our homeward say. Of course^
it is going to take us two months and a half to get there, but four months have gone. he left Aswan early Friday morning and reached Luxj, too late Sunday A.M. for D. and me to go to church. We had expected I. to come down flying, having the current in our favor, as well as ttf tug, but mad winds and many sandbars interrupted our progress. Not I; that D and I minded - it was interesting to watch the crew getting us! off sandbars. We -pent the rest of Sunday, and all of Monday and Tues: day at Luxor, tied up as nearly as possible in our old place, and wit nothing very exciting doing. Doris paid one final visit to Karnak
