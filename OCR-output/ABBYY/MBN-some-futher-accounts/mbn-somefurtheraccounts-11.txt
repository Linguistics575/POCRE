alone so I went with her.	Our vehicle	was a	sort of surrey thing	dravif
by two mules and driven by	a pirate in	baggy	white "trou." When we
finally entered the	Valley ray breath was taken away. It	was like driy
ing on a very	good,	glaring white road through the	wreck	of the world,?
Absolutely the desert, not a suggestion of a growing thing anywhere. Towering cliffs all about us, wild masses of rock hurled everywhere, i less stretches of broken fragments of flint and limestone and fossiliz shells, the blazing sun, the splendid cloudless sky. The house is in what is called the West Valley, which, though it contains two or three ; tombs, is not the valley of the Tombs,	being	divided from that by	a
ridge. The house is long,	low (one storied)	flat-roofed, made of	roug
stone, plastered with mud, and looking like thousands of Mexican house It stands in a narrow part of the valley with cliffs directly behind i and a stone’s	throw	across the road in front of it	another ridge divid
ing it from a	third	valley. The bedrooms are like	cells	with little s
of windows in the foot-and-a-half thick walls. The sitting room is bn and mannish and the dining room ditto, - but all very neat. Harry Bur is a delightfully orderly person. You know he is managing your uncle*; excavations and so lives out there in the house. All the water used t is brought miles in jars on donkeyback - as it was in Ecuador. Threr j an excellent cook, and a houseboy and two guards. A guard armed with' rifle stands at the front corner of the house all night.
Saturday morning we fill proceeded to the Valley of the Tombs, Cousin T mounted on Julius Caesar (a perfect devil of a black donkey who loves j his own voice so he brays all the time), Cousin Emma in a chair carrid by two men and D. & I on foot. It was a sensation of a lifetime to ] visit that place for the first time. A number of tombs are open to tlj public, so George Bourne will have no difficulty in gratifying his del But Cousin T. is doing the only excavating now going on in the valley,' it was amusing to pass by groups of gazing, gaping tourists end disapp into an opening labelled "Mo Admittance" from which were issuing cloucj of dust and a procession of children carrying dirt and rocks in basket which they emptied on a dump. Most of the manual labor in excavation: in this region is done by children and I hate it. They are urged on I overseers with whips. But our overseer was deprived of his whip last year when Harry saw him cut a piece out of a boy’s leg with the lash.
Time fails to tell you of the marvels of the tombs we saw.That afternoon I took a walk alone and climbed a ridge and went down into anothi valley and up on the ridge beyond. And the sun went down, and withou1 sunshine it is the most terrible place I ever saw. The silence was di ful, and I was suddenly siezed w’ith a horror of the desert and fled b: to the house where I was much rebuked for wandering off by myself. Sunday afternoon Cousin T. on Julius and D. & I on our tooties explori the West Valley away up beyond the house, and why all the kings didn'' make their tombs there I cannot understand. It is the most regal, stunning and awe inspiring place I think I ever saw.
Cousin Emma and I came home to the Daha bya Monday morning and gl^d enough we were to get here. But Cousin Theodore and Doris -tarried ti yesterday. He perfectly (excuse me!) adores it. But it would get on nerves terribly unless I had all my occupations and were really- livinl there.
