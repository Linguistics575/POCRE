as sorry for the unhappy fellow whose skate struck Crosson as I do for him. It would be so hideous to carry through life the memory of hnvir done a thing like that even if it was utterly unavoidable. I hope you won't forget to tell me in your next how he is coming on.
I shall have to give your love to Wadi Haifa, Sugar's successor. I've never set eyes on Sugar since the day long ago when I got off him bouncing and braying on an embankment and vowed I’d not ride him again.
Good night, my Darling. I do get so terribly homesick for you sometimes that I'd give all the pomp and circumstance of Egypt to be back at 615 Orange St.
God bless you and keep you.safe.
Your loving

Oh Gopher, I don't know what I would not have given to have h-*>d you here today to go with us on our expedition to the Great Dam. It surely must be one of the Wonders of the World - and what a feat of engineering!
We left Luxor Saturday the 1st and got here yesterday the 4th - 133 miles Baedeker says. Awfully slow going, - but then we stopped tw’ice, the first time at Edfu that Doris and I might see the temple there; and the second time at Kom Ombo ;■ for us to inspect that temple, and also because the wind was bloving so terrifically that navigation was excessively unpleasant, -so we tied up there fit about one on Monday and didn't start again until early the next (ye s terday) morning. Although we were within two minutes walk of.the temple D. and I did not stir off the boat until five o'clock when the wind died down. That Kom Cm-bo temple is an extraordinary one because it is duplex - one side being dedicated to a good god - the elder Horus, and the other to the bad crocodile god, Sebek or Sobk. I prefer the later name because it sounds like a crocodile, if said down in your throat with full value given to all the consonants. There is one room in a little chapel on Sobk's side which is full ofmummied crocodiles - quite the ho-rridest things I've seen in a long while. The temple is in a most ruinous condition, but, perhaps, all the more beautiful for that, and the situation and views fire superb. D. and I climbed up on the wreck 6f a splendid pylon and sat there watching the sunset and indulging in a pleasant melancholy, and had it all to ourselves,,except for the faithful escort, Haneen and a sailor, who dogged our feetsteps. It really is awfully good of the Cousins to bring us up here - for they are tired to death of it, having seen it so many times, and they don't go anywhere or do anything except stayr on the boat and arrange for us to see the sights. Yesterday morning shortly after we left Kom Ombo we found a mile of flamingoes standing in ranks and files on the sandbars!
Iv e arrived here about 12:30 yesterday and it was a joyful crew that tied us up, for most of them live here. Doris and I did the bazaar yesterday afternoon with Haneen to drive bargains for us and Amelie and a. sailor in our train. You understand that "the bazaar" in these towns means a long narrow street, or streets, with the roofs nearly meeting overhead and tiny shallow little shops like pigeonholes all along on both sides.
Ke thought the bazaar in Cairo enthralling, but it falls short of this one though it's much larger. This one so reeks of the desert and the strange things that come out of it. You would have gone wild over the
