Emma and me and trotted over to the Valley to spend the night* while we-, had to sit tamely on deck like perfect ladies, and dispense tea and cakes to strange Americans from Buffalo whom we had never seen before.
Sir Gaston Maspero was to join them the next morning at the Tombs and pronounce judgement on the red granite sarcophagus. The next afternoon 1 had just got back from a long walk (accompanied by a sailor with a heavy stick,) packed with fleas which I had annexed in a native village I suddenly found myself in; and was having tea on deck in company with th< Contessa Contardone and Mr. Tremaine when the cavalcade returned from the Volley. It had quite the effect in a mild way of explorers returning from the African desert as they came in single file across the sands; fir the sumpter mule (so to speak) with the luggage, then Cousin T., Doris & Jones with the donkey boys running beside thenp, and Julius Caesar braying his head off as they came. Doris was beaming. She had had the most wonderful time with Maspero who had lunched with them in the House in the Valley and who talked as she never had heard anyone talk before.
He pronounced the sarcophagus a treasure, wants it for the Museum in Cairo, but also wants Cousin Theodore to pay the insignificant sum of 250 poinds sterling for its transportation therej
The Contessa invited Doris and me to go on a picnic the next day at the great temple of Medinet Habu, to see the magic performances of a noted Arab snake-charmer she had persuaded to come down from Esneh for the purpose. We went, and it was an extraordinary experience. (Doris had a nasty spill on the way out. Her donkey stepped into a pitfall, flung her, fell on her and kicked her, but she insisted on going on, with her usual pluck, and in the end suffered no serious effects). I simply haven't time to give you an account of what happened at the ruins. It was both dramatic and astounding. The Arab stalking in front of the picnic, who all straggled after him, recited some sort of incantation in a loud clear voice, and lured snakes from out of thornbushes on the desert and the coy cobra from chinks in the temple wall.
Yesterday I played in a tennis tournament at the Winter Palace and carried off a cup (the 1st Prize),- not by my own prowess but by that of my partner, a very nice Scotchman named MacNaughton who played a corking game.
This afternoon D. & I went over there again on invitation to watch a rather mild but quite amusing gymkhana, and enjoyed ourselves immensely. And now I must turn in and get some of that sleep that 1 seem to require more here than anywhere else in the world.	I	suppose	now	you
cannot gret that operation done till the Spring vacation. I wonder if postponing it was wise.
Oceans of love, dearest, from

Darling Gopher -	We	are	now	wondering	whether Edith was allowed
to return to New Haven for the Prom proper. In a letter Doris had from Dick he said he had met you on the street and you had told him of your hopes and fears (though he didn't put it that way.) I have a feeling that she did come back. I fancy' Mrs. Pinch likes now and then to make a bluff at being very strict and keep people in suspense, I shall await your description of the Prom with interest and such patience as I can summon to my aid. It's two weeks since I've had a letter from you.
I was rejoiced yesterday by one from Golden from Mrs. Moses, which
