Darling Gopher - The ca-fele which John sent rae telling of his father's death was five days late in being delivered to me. I cabled at once t<j Auntie Paige, and of course followed that message immediately by a lett If they telegraphed you I do hopcyou did the proper thing. I cannot feeling very anxious about Paige. She has been under such a tremendous strain for so long that I'm afraid under the sudden cessation of it she 3 may	go to pieces.	Of course you will go to	see her	at once in Clevel^
and	I beg you to write me at once all about	her. I	hope	Winifred has
taken the baby to Cleveland. Nothing in the world coiid divert Paige or help her as much as that baby.
Your letter of the 21 Nov. reached me Saturday the 7th and rejoiced me through and through. I'm also glad that you have decided to live at th Hall - if it is not going to interfere with your work and keep you up too	late at night.	As to your surgical operation,	I do	not anticipate
any	trouble at all	from that. Nevertheless	I shall	want	a line immedia,
tely - sooner than you will feel like writing it; so arrange with the doctor or one of your friends to write me at once. If it were a more serious thing I should, of course, want a cable.	j
We go on living in the Arabian Nights. We had tea yesterday afternoon on the dahabenh, with the most wonderful lights on the river-that haunt ing river Nile; white walled palaces, backed by towering palm trees, gleaming out on the opposite shore; a fleet of boats with their beautir ful, slanting sails moving so slowly that they seemed not to move at *1 until suddenly you found they had vanished around a bend. Before our guests arrived we were immensely amused by a little scene enacted on ( bank to which the Beduin is tied. We have a snow-white cock and three hens, a gorgeous drake and three ducks which we take with us when we set sail, and which made the voyage up the river last year. The ducks were off visiting a neighboring dahabeah yesterday when we arrived, but when whistled for came paddling up for dear life. In the meantime the, cock and hens had wandered along the bank till they arrived at the plm close to the boat, which the drake regards as his own domain. Instant! the drake waddled out of the water and made for the cock, dabbing at h: legs until he drove him off. Tn his pride of victory and the attitude he struck he really' looked like Napoleon.
Our. guests were Prof. Sayrle, an Oxford Don, explorer and scientist, Artirr Pasha, an Armenian'archa eologist of distinction, and an Egyptian gentleman, Claudius Bey, whose hair turned snow white a few yeors ago when upon going on board a steamer, just landed at Alexandria, to meet his wife - he found her lying in her stateroom with her throat cut.
She had been murdered by a steward.
I talked with Prof. Say'le for some time, or rather I listened while he talked. He told me some inside history' about Gordon, which was absorb-ingly interesting, - particularly' so to me as Gordon has always been of of my' heroes. Ve had expected to move onto the dahabeah today' and sail tomorrow but we've been delayed a day. Not that I care - for I've not begun to see the wonders of this city-.
