’e left Luxor shortly after eleven, I think, yesterday morning and it was gectic getting off The sands were dotted with natives who Sad come to say goodbye, and get a parting backshish, and on the Luxor side, as we passed, tradesmen whom we had patronized, and many friends of the crew waved frantically at us. We have come skimming down t^s far - «nd oh these lovely banks! They are covered with poppies now m long stretches Ve got to Dendereh yeaterday afternoon about i\ e an smppe or or^s and me to see that temple. Jones said it was a VuT) it e w a v. "A little walk" in this family means not more than a ten-minute one, so we started on foot. But it had been some years since Jones had done it and he had forgotten. It was a mos , i no quite, two miles there, which wouldn*t have mattered m the lease 1 it hadn’t been so late. Two sailors were sent with us, and we walked as fast as we COuld, but we only got there in time o see the sunset from the roof- which alone was worth the expedition, and then fairl}" tore through the dim recesses of the temple and down into the most.amazing crypt, it was so spooky there that it was com-orhng to think that the Gaffir - having seen our athletic guardians at the gates o± the temple _ would not dare to murder us as he so easily might. It«as a wonderful walk back - quite recompensing us ior the calling down that awaited us. The relatives had grown Tightened about our being out after dark, and were cross in consequence. Of course it was Jones who out to have been called dow - but con_i ering al Jones does f0r us I’d always rather take » scolding ^han have him get one. We started out with an escort of two sailors, and e came back -with four sailors (two more having been sent out to mee. us) .wo n-ruive men who had attached themselves to the party, two children and two goats
