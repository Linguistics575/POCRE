Mon., Oct. 20 1913 Alexandria Clear & warm.
I rose for breakfast this A.M. The day was glorious - warm & sunny.
Alexandria "hove in sight" soon after 3 & at 5 o'c. we made fast to the pier, just as the sun was setting. There was a howling mass of Arabs eager to be porters & tho' I meant to steer clear of them & be my own conductor thro' the customs & to a cab, I finally allowed one of the most insistent to help me, so that before 6 I was landed bag & baggage at the Windsor Hotel. At 7:30 I ate a big dinner, thankful I'd not staid in Italy.

I felt wretched this A.M. Have a beastly buzzing in my ear wh. has kept up for the last 2 days. Feeling nervously unfit for work I took a 4 mi. walk out into the desert & back this A.M. It was rather too much for me so I was quite worthless the rest of the day. I ate nothing as my in'ards are upset. I started Arnold Bennett's "Buried Alive>"
